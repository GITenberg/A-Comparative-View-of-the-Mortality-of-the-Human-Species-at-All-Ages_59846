HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS<br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">George</span> Prince of Wales.</p>

<p>
May it please your <span class="smcap">Royal Highness</span>,<br />
</p>

<p>A Young and celebrated Prince, before his first
Military Expedition, interrogated one of his
experienced Relations and Instructors, How he should
conduct himself to be respected and obeyed by his
Army?—“To know more of the Profession than any
of your Soldiers,” was the sage Reply; and to the
renowned Cyrus, the Conqueror of the Babylonians.
This Maxim is, in some Degree, applicable and pertinent
throughout all the Gradations and Scale of Society.
A Prince, born to the Throne of a mighty
Empire, pre-eminent in its Political Constitution, and
in the universal Range of the Arts and Sciences, is
urged by his Personal Dignity and Public Duty, to
aspire to the intrinsick Qualifications of Human Supremacy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">{vi}</a></span></p>

<p>In the present small Tribute of Duty and Respect, I
am not submitting to your Royal Highness a dry,
technical Analysis of Diseases. An enlarged Survey
of Medicine is intimately interwoven with most of
the sublime Objects, not only of Philosophy, but, in
our original Chart and Model, of Politicks also and
Legislation, both in Peace and War. It transcends the
British Poet’s Limitation of Human Studies, the
Knowledge of Man: it embraces a Scope of Natural
Knowledge far beyond any other of the learned Professions;
encompassing in its spacious Orbit most of
the grand Divisions of Science. A total Ignorance in
this, would leave a dreary Chasm in Literature; and,
like the ancient Geography, the Map and Globe of
intellectual Discoveries would be half unexplored.</p>

<p>In early Ages, when Medicine had not reached beyond
the Merit of a few Empirical Cures, the Consultation
in consecrated Temples of Medical Oracles
was ingrafted with Divinity and Objects of Worship.
The Rays of Majesty were not then obstructed from
cherishing this tender Shoot. From the encouragement
of Alexander, Aristotle’s Natural History had its
Origin. From the Patronage of his Successors to
the Egyptian Throne, the Ptolemys, first arose Human
Anatomy, together with the magnificent Alexandrian
Library. Many of the first Miracles of Christianity
are a Display of Medical Omnipotence. By several of
the Asiatic and Roman Emperors, their Physicians were
admitted to a Familiarity, and to their Tables: their
Archiaters, or Royal Physicians, held the Second Rank
in the Empire; and even, so late as Constantine, were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">{vii}</a></span>
created Counts. The Arabians, Mahomet’s Successors,
were unbounded in their Rewards and Encouragement
of Medicine. With the Destruction of the
Roman Empire, Science lay many Centuries buried in
its Ashes. But on the Recovery from Feudal Anarchy,
and the Revival of Literature after the Crusades,
those raised to the Degree of Doctor in any of
the learned Professions, contended Precedence with the
most respectable then in any European State, with
Military Knighthood.</p>

<p>In Britain, and most other Kingdoms of Europe,
Italy excepted, Literature of any Sort, of Native
Growth, is but a modern Plant. Medicine in this
Island is an Exotic, until within the last Three Centuries;
and since that Period, seems to have scrambled
into Consequence and Emolument, from its own intrinsic
Merit, and the public Encouragement. For
Truth compels me to observe, that the Favours and
Honours of Majesty have been measured out, even to
the Benefactors of Science and of Mankind, in this
Profession, with a parsimonious and partial Hand. I
do not presume to arraign the Wisdom or Justice of
your Royal Ancestors, but of their Counsellors and
Ministers; in whom there seems a Sort of epidemical
or entailed Infatuation and Bigotry to lavish the first
Honours of the State upon the Memory of dry
Laws, and the specious Accomplishments of Logick
and Rhetorick.</p>

<p>Your Royal Highness is at present, through the
bountiful Beneficence of Nature, and the variegated
Acquisitions of Education, endowed with most of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">{viii}</a></span>
preliminary Embellishments requisite in your exalted
Station, and to a Summit of Celebrity and Admiration.
The Rudiments, Difficulties, and Acclivities
are surmounted, and leave you an uninterrupted Range
through Parnassus, in the Fruition of the luxurious
Feasts furnished by Apollo and the Muses. In a political
View, and in their public Administration
throughout all the Professions, and Medicine notoriously,
there are numerous Defects and Abuses originating
from the Ignorance and Inexperience of former
Ages, the Corruptions and Innovations of Time, and
from various other Causes. With thousands of these
remediable Diseases, the most enlightened Nations are
yet over-run and contaminated; and a Monarch who
would emulate a Trajan or an Aurelius, will find glorious
Employment as a Political Physician. He will
have the divine Consolation and Reflection of circulating
his Knowledge through innumerable Channels,
to the Benefit, Happiness, Nurture, and Preservation
of Millions of Mankind.</p>

Rank amongst the other Celestial Orbs; and
of its Investing Elements:—of the Habitable
Parts of our Planet: the Number of the
Human Species, and their Division into various
Classes, Genera, Groups, and Gradations:
their Comparative Births.</i></p>


<p><span class="large_text uppercase">There</span> are two methods of promoting
Medical Knowledge: one by
negative information, or criticisms on the
numerous errors of preceding authors: the
other by direct instruction, and improvement
on former models. The first method is worn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">{ii}</a></span>
out in hackneyed chimes: the second is encumbered
with infinitely more difficulties;
and its merits paramount in the superlative
degree. However unequal I have imposed
upon myself the latter task. But, previous
to the discussion of the general theme, it will
conduce to order, and to the anticipation of
explanatory digression and illustration, to
glance at the station, rotation, and rank of
our Parent Planet amongst the other celestial
orbs; at its investing elements; and at the
number, groups, and recruit of mankind.
A navigator or historian, who undertakes
the description of any island, kingdom, or
continent, commences with their geographical
outlines and climate, penetrating afterwards
thorough a scrutiny of the inhabitants.
Upon a similar, but more majestic model, our
Introductory Preface is founded. Throughout
the whole of this intricate, sublime, and
inexhaustible subject, if I do not delay sufficient
time to fix, I shall at least hope to start
the reader’s attention to a variety of grand
objects, inseparable from a comprehensive
knowledge of Medicine; and of which I
shall touch the fundamental keys and
chords.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">{iii}</a></span></p>

<h3 class="header">The Solar System</h3> <p class="header">consists of the Sun, of
seven Planets surrounded by ten or more
Moons, and of the Comets. The other
siderial lights with which the vault of Heaven
is studded, and which are denominated
Fixed Stars, have a very distant affinity
with our planetary sphere: they are infinitely
too remote to be enlightened by our
luminary; and therefore astronomers, with
good reason, imagine each star to be a sun
to encircling planets, though invisible to us;
and to constitute throughout boundless space
thousands, or perhaps millions, of habitable
worlds. Numbers of those stars, most luminous
and proximate, are arranged into arbitrary
clusters, called Constellations, or Signs;
and serve to mark the several stages of the
rotating orbs in our system.</p>

<p>The Sun, whose magnitude far surpasses
that of the seven planets united, is placed in
the center, suspended in the immense celestial
expansion and firmament. Surrounding him,
at different distances, and in the following
order, are the planets Mercury, Venus, the
Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Georgium
Sidus. These planets are incessantly re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">{iv}</a></span>volving
from west-by-south to east, and
within certain intervals of time, make a
complete circle round the Sun; which is
the length of each planet’s year; and is
larger and longer in proportion to their respective
distances. The velocity of their
revolution in their annual orbits, together
with their gradations of light and heat, are
also in proportion to their solar proximity.
From the Sun, the Planets, with their surrounding
moons, derive heat and light;
and when this is intercepted by any planet,
or its satellite, an eclipse or darkness ensues.
In what periods those tremendous
celestial bodies, named Comets, revolve
round the Sun, is not yet exactly adjusted.</p>

<h3 class="faux" title="The earth’s figure, magnitude, motion"></h3>

<p>One of the seven planets, the Earth, this
small domain of restless mortals, and to
which all our future observations shall be
directed, is distant from the Sun 95,173,000
miles. In shape, it has more resemblance
to a turnip than to a globe. Its diameter
is 7,970 miles: its circumference 360 degrees;
which amounts to 24,840 English
miles. Geographers divide the globe of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">{v}</a></span>
planet into two equal parts, or hemispheres,
the northern and southern, by an imaginary
girdle, or ring, named the Equator.
Two other imaginary girdles surrounding
the earth, and distant from the equator
on each side 23½ degrees, north and south
latitude, are named the Tropicks of Cancer
and Capricorn; comprehending between
them the torrid zone. From these tropical
circles the zones, called Temperate, extend
on each side 43 degrees: and at their
extreme boundaries, we reach the polar
circles 23½ degrees distant from each pole.
The north and the south poles are in the
middle of each hemisphere of the earth; and
the distance of each from the equator is 90
degrees.</p>

<p>The earth has several incessant motions:
one in which it turns, like a suspended
wheel upon its own axis, from west to east,
every twenty-four hours, which is the
length of its day and night: the second,
where it is rolling progressively in its great
annual circle, or journey round the Sun:
the third, the alternate inclination of its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">{vi}</a></span>
poles towards the sun at different times of
the year: the fourth, the small circle which
it describes monthly round the common center
of gravity, or balance, with its moon.
The earth’s diurnal revolution upon its
axis, is at the rate of fifteen degrees, or
1,035 miles hourly. But the rapidity with
which it is whirled in its annual orbit,
is, hourly, 68,243 miles: whereas the
swiftness of a ball discharged from a cannon
is, in the same time, only 480 miles.
Projected through the vacuity of heaven
with this amazing velocity, in the space of
365 days, 5 hours, and 49 minutes, the
earth completes its annual circle; which
is the length of our year. The earth’s rotation
every twenty-four hours upon its
axis, is the cause of day and night, or of
light and darkness. In this successive rotation,
one half of its globular surface is always
enlightened; the other half being
then obscured in nocturnal gloom, except
when enlivened by the reflected rays of the
moon, or of one of the planets, or by the
fainter glimmering of the fixed stars. The
alternate spiral inflection and declination of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">{vii}</a></span>
the earth’s poles during its annual journey
round the Sun, is the cause of the different
lengths of Days and Nights; of the Seasons;
of Summer and Winter; of the Equinoxes,
and Solstices: and as each pole inclines or
recedes, it is summer and winter, alternately,
in their respective hemispheres. The effects
of this compound terrestrial circumvolution
on the animal and vegetable creation, would
alone be a magnificent theme for many volumes.</p>

<h3 class="faux" title="Of the moon"></h3>
<p>One Moon only is allotted to our earth;
from which it is distant 240,000 miles.
The moon’s diameter is nearly one fourth
less than that of the earth, which it obsequiously
accompanies throughout its annual
circuit; and round which it makes a perpetual
revolution, from west to east, every lunar
month. The constant agitation and periodical
surges of the ocean, are greatly influenced
by the moon, assisted, however, by the
centrifugal force of the earth’s motion. It
is also ascertained, that in some diseases, the
human body is considerably under the lunar
influence; and its energy is still more conspicuous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">{viii}</a></span>
at periodical changes, during the
month and the year. Many arguments might
be suggested to invalidate and overturn the
ancient astrological systems, and to prove
that the celestial influences upon us are not,
in any considerable degree, derived from
sources more remote than the solar confines.</p>

<h3 class="faux" title="The investing elements of the earth"></h3>

<p>The first Element in pre-eminence and
subtility, without which all would be lifeless
chaos in our system, is Heat and Light.
Cold is a negative quality, and merely a
comparative diminution of heat. The
middle regions of the earth being repeatedly
more exposed to the Sun’s vertical rays, are
consequently most heated and scorched.
From the equator to the poles, are all the
gradations of heat and cold; but for reasons
too prolix to enumerate, these gradations are
not in exact measurement with the geographical
distances from the equator; neither
in the same continent, nor in different continents.
By the scale of Farenheit’s thermometer,
water boils at 212, freezes at 32;
and blood-heat, or that of the human body,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">{ix}</a></span>
is about 97. The most intense heat of the
tropical regions, as measured by the same
thermometer, is frequently many degrees
above the human temperature; and the
most intense cold of the polar regions, often
many degrees below 1 or 0 of the same scale.
Neither of these noxious extremes of pestilential
heat, nor of deadning blasts from
boreal snow, could be long endured by the
human species, were their bodies not protected
and skreened by fences of nature or
of art. Atmospheric heat, equal even to
that of the human body, is felt intolerably
scorching and suffocating. Every one also
knows, by personal experience, that in different
latitudes, and in summer and winter,
the degrees of heat and cold, the duration,
recurrence, and changes, are extremely
variable. But within the equatorial limits,
these variations are much less conspicuous,
both in the thermometer and barometer.
From this main spring and soul
of animated nature, blessings and bounties
are diffused, in thousands of channels, to
every order of the creation; and from its
extremes and vicissitudes, a multitude of
evils and diseases are inflicted upon man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">{x}</a></span></p>

<h3 class="faux" title="Atmosphere and winds, &amp;c."></h3>

<p>Between the earth and celestial vacuum
is interposed an element, called the Atmosphere,
or Air. This invisible elastic fluid is
floating equally round our planet, to the
distance of at least forty-five miles perpendicular
elevation. It has been compared
by some philosophers, to packs of wool
heaped on each other: that nearest the
ground is most dense, compact, and ponderous;
and as we ascend, it becomes gradually
more rare, light, and cold. The
prodigious gravity, or pressure, of this atmospherick
column, appears incredible to
those who are ignorant of experimental philosophy,
and of the air-pump and barometer.
Upon a man’s body, of middle stature, its
weight is equal to thirty-two or thirty-three
thousand pounds: but in rainy and variable
weather, and especially on the summit
of high mountains, there is a diminution
in its pressure of many thousand pounds.
This great mass of air, as well as the
waters of the ocean and of rivers, is in
constant agitation; sometimes gliding in
gentle calms; sometimes, with wild uproar,
raging in storms and hurricanes, and dispersed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">{xi}</a></span>
in a variety of currents, over different parts
of the earth and ocean in Winds, constant,
periodical, variable, and irregular. Without
the concurrent support of air, animal and
vegetable life would soon be annihilated.
On them great and sensible effects are produced
by the atmosphere and winds: by
the air’s noxious impregnation, stagnation,
want of elasticity, heat, cold, moisture, dryness;
by the points from whence winds
blow, their constancy, irregularity, recurrence,
velocity.</p>

<h3 class="faux" title="Rain, snow, &amp;c."></h3>

<p>The earth is the cistern, and one principal
fountain of another still grosser element.
From the Sun’s heat, and from the successive
streams of air and winds, a prodigious
evaporation is carried on from the surface
of the ocean, from the land, and from vegetables.
Whether part of the atmospherick
air is also converted into vapour, is a question
too intricate and diffuse for our present
inquiry. The critical analysis and history
of a single element, would alone far exceed
the limits of this Dissertation. It is sufficient
for us to observe, that these vapours,
terrestrial and aerial, are collected into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">{xii}</a></span>
clouds, condensed, and again discharged
upon the earth in Dews, Mists, Fogs, Rains,
Snow, and Hail. The precipitation likewise
of this accumulated vapour upon different
parts of the globe, is periodical, regular,
and variable. In quantity, duration,
recurrence, and extent, these aqueous modifications
are greatly diversified by the climate
and soil, the vicinity to mountains
and sea-coasts; the points from whence
winds blow; and by many other causes, of
which a detail cannot be here expected.
From this source also ensue salutary and
baneful effects, innumerable to animal and
vegetable life.</p>

<h3 class="faux" title="Electrical emanation"></h3>

<p>Another subtile and active agent in the
secret machinery of nature, is the Electrical
Emanation; which, somewhat perhaps analogous
to the aqueous evaporation and congestion
before mentioned, is collected into
clouds, and, with loud explosion, again discharged
and dispersed into the air and earth:
the fabulous thunderbolts and artillery of
Omnipotence.</p>

<h3 class="faux" title="The earth’s division into land and water, and into continents"></h3>

<p>We now alight upon that solid mass,
Earth, the most fixed and substantial of all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">{xiii}</a></span>
the elements. The surface of our planet is
composed of dry land and water; of which
the ocean, without including lakes and rivers,
occupies by much the largest extent.
But the partition of the dry land into four
continents, Europe, Asia, Africa, and America,
is not well founded. Nature has in
reality formed only three great insulated
continents, exclusive of the smaller islands.
Europe and Asia are contiguous, and cemented
together as England and Scotland;
or as France and Germany; and their
boundaries artificial: whereas Africa, except
the slender neck of land near Alexandria,
is surrounded by sea. Of these four
continents, Europe is the most diminutive.
Asia and America stand dignified,
above all the others, in superior magnitude.
The dry land in Europe, Asia, and America,
stretches to a great northern latitude,
considerably within the arctick, or polar circles;
and, spreading also in that part to a
wide extent, east and west, forms nearly a
complete bridge between Asia and America.
Within the tropical circles are included the
belly and bulge of Africa, and of South<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">{xiv}</a></span>
America, with a considerable portion of
the broken southern extremities of Asia;
together with most of the principal islands
in the Pacific and Atlantic oceans. In
all the hemisphere south of Capricorn,
the land is greatly disproportioned to the
ocean. The conical south point of America
is but 55, and that of Africa only 35
degrees distant from the equator. A vast
orbicular segment of this extreme of our
planet, furnishes habitation for fishes only.
The dry land is also diversified by elevations
and plains; but in no part of the earth’s
circumference do those stately monuments
of nature’s workmanship ascend to five miles
perpendicular elevation.</p>

<h3 class="faux" title="The situation of the human species upon the earth"></h3>

<p>The Creator has bountifully stored the
earth and the ocean with animals and vegetables.
Our attention is here circumscribed
to the most exalted class, the Human Species;
leaving to the naturalist a description
of quadrupeds, birds, fishes, insects, and
vegetables. By far the largest proportion of
the human species are stationed to the north
side of the equator, and even to the north of
the tropick of cancer. The populous continents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">{xv}</a></span>
of Europe and Asia, comprehending
most of the powerful kingdoms in our
planet, are in the northern hemisphere.
Within the tropical circles and furnace of
the earth, are stationed the next considerable
hive of mankind. To the south of Capricorn
there are few inhabitants. Some
wretched human beings are also scattered
through those dreary wastes of ice and snow
within the northern polar circles.</p>

<h3 class="faux" title="The number of the human species"></h3>

<p>Calculators differ enormously respecting
the <i>number of the Human Species</i>. Some sink
the collected herd so low as three hundred
million, whilst others exaggerate them to
treble and quadruple that amount. It forms
no part of my scheme to investigate the
comparative population of the earth, one,
two, and three thousand years ago. Europe,
in all probability, since the era of Roman
grandeur, has, together with advancement
in civilization, likewise added to the
number of its inhabitants. Those parental
nurseries of the arts and sciences in Asia and
Africa, have no doubt undergone various revolutions
in population. If we were to
draw any inferences from the numerous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">{xvi}</a></span>
Asiatic armies, during the successive despotism
of Assyrian, Babylonian, Medean, and
Persian monarchies, we should conclude that,
in remote ages, the south of Asia abounded
in men. The extensive empire of China,
at this day, resembles an industrious beehive,
and is gorged with mankind. We have
still more aversion to plunge into the mysterious
archives of Africa, and with critical
affectation to pronounce upon the population
of that quarter before the decay of its
political, commercial, and literary fame
with Thebes, Carthage, and Alexandria.
That modern-discovered transatlantic continent,
from the cruelties and desolation of
its first conquerors, and of a loathsome infectious
disease exchanged for another, has
probably suffered considerable diminution
of its original feeble hive, notwithstanding
the recruit from Europe; and in the scale
of population, as yet ascends to a very subordinate
rank amongst the other continents.
The most probable calculations estimate
the whole human race at eight hundred
million: of which number, Europe boasts
of little more than one hundred million.
The great swarm is in Asia; amounting to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">{xvii}</a></span>
between four and five hundred million. Africa
is supposed to contain one third or fourth
of the latter number. Over the fertile wilderness
of America are scattered not altogether
twenty million.</p>

<p>But if in London alone, where registers
of various kinds may be consulted, calculators
are, notwithstanding, at variance
respecting its population upwards of one
hundred thousand, and in the whole island
more than a million; it may be reasonably
suspected, that in forming a gross estimate
of the aggregate terrestrial inhabitants, we
may err perhaps, one, two, or even three
hundred million. As well might we expect
a correct list of the lions, crocodiles, and
monkies of Africa, as of the outcast human
race in those burning and illiterate regions.
To determine the exact amount of inhabitants
in any civilized kingdom, the most
certain method would be, to make an universal
and arithmetical numeration throughout
every dwelling. This is often done in
several kingdoms; and in none more culpably
neglected than in this island. English
calculators, therefore, have been under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">{xviii}</a></span>
necessity, by other laborious processes, to
form at least plausible conjectures of the national
population. One of their methods
is, by collecting the number of houses, and
allotting five, or four and a half inhabitants
to each house; which, at a general
medium, was found near the standard of
truth, in a multitude of large towns and
open districts in England, Holland, Germany,
Switzerland, and Italy; as may be
seen recorded in the writings of Short,
Susmilch, Price, and many others. In some
particular cities, however, such as Berlin,
Vienna, Paris, and Edinburgh, where several
families are crowded into one house, this
rule would lead into error. Besides, in
ours, and many other large kingdoms, we
are not yet supplied with an authentick register
of all the dwellings. And in Asia
and Africa, whose political institutions and
customs are so different from us, this scale
of mensuration may be still more erroneous.
Another method, but still more
complex and uncertain, of computing the
population is, by the annual christenings
and burials. When these are equal, and
consequently there is no increase or decrease<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">{xix}</a></span>
of the inhabitants, we are directed to multiply
the usual prospect or decrement of life,
or in the mathematical phrase, the expectation
of an infant at birth in that city,
town, or district, by the general medium of
christenings; which will be the total local
amount of the inhabitants. But as the
christenings and burials are rarely equal,
or a correct list of either can be ascertained
from the imperfect registers, this process is
very defective.</p>

<h3 class="faux" title="The multiplication of the human species"></h3>

<p>The Multiplication of the human species
depends greatly on society. There are
more inhabitants concentrated into one
large metropolis of Asia or Europe, than
could be collected in many thousand miles
of the North-American wilderness on its
first discovery. The population of the
earth is by no means regulated by the extent
of country. If, on the one hand,
high refinement and large cities are obstacles
to population, a wild state of nature
is still more detrimental. A few tribes of
North American natives, prowling like
hungry wolves, can scarce find precarious
subsistence in a wide extent of uncultivated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">{xx}</a></span>
desarts. Their infants, from necessity,
are suckled several years; and after
rearing two or three, the period of propagation
is nearly over. A medium state between
the vicious extremes of refinement
and rude savageness; or the middle stages
between the iron and golden ages of the
ancient philosophers, is most favourable to
the increase of our species. But the causes
conducive to population and depopulation,
are of infinite compass; and are of a compound
nature, medical and political. They
are connected with the state of government,
religion, climate, genius, industry, riches,
poverty, taxes, luxury, refinement, wars,
colonization, emigration, commerce, agriculture,
the unequal distribution and monopoly
of property and farms, the plenty,
scarcity, and cheapness of food; and, with
many other causes, closely allied to our future
medicinal investigation.  Under governments
and nurture, directed with political
and moral, together with medical prudence
and circumspection, the earth and
ocean would probably afford ample nutriment,
and their population might be multiplied
to three times eight hundred million.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">{xxi}</a></span></p>

<h3 class="faux" title="The distinction of the human species into classes"></h3>

<p>Extending our views over the surface of
the globe, we perceive striking distinctions
between the human species; not only in the
four great continents, but also in different
parts of the same continent. These differences
are principally manifest in the
colour of the skin; in the complexion,
countenance, physiognomy, hair, form, and
stature. We attend here merely to corporeal
distinction, without including the intellectual.
These great Classes of mankind
may be divided into the Laplander, the
Tartar, the Chinese, the European, the
African-negro, and the native American.
The modern-discovered inhabitants in the
islands of the Pacific ocean, seem to have
no remarkable cast of countenance or figure
to sever them into a separate class. But
throughout a considerable extent of the
globe, from conquest, emigration, colonization,
and commercial intercourse, many
nations are now blended and assimilated
into one; and their elementary characteristic
features more faintly imprinted. Besides,
every one’s experience and observation will
instruct him, that in populous kingdoms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">{xxii}</a></span>
those classes branch out into innumerable intermixtures,
orders, and genera; and that
the species and varieties are as numerous
as the individuals of the human race.
Amongst the ab-origines, and stationary inhabitants
of most kingdoms, there are indeed
some prominent features peculiar to
each community; which are, in some degree,
conspicuous in the corporeal, and still
more in the mental outlines. Mankind,
exclusive of their original mould, as issued
from the mint of the Creator, are afterwards
diversified by climate, soil, diet, government,
religion, association, occupation,
and habit.</p>

<h3 class="faux" title="Mankind diversified by civilization"></h3>

<p>By Civilization, mankind are arranged
and connected into an infinite series of descending
and dependent links. In a state
of nature there are few gradations in society;
few professions or mechanical arts.
Mr. Voltaire makes two great divisions of
mankind; the oppressors, and the oppressed.
Descending the mole-hill and ladder
from the throne to the cottage, we may
trace a multitude of gradations in the scale
of polished communities. We descend thro’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">{xxiii}</a></span>
nobility and gentry of independent fortunes,
in lands or money; through literary professions,
including divinity, medicine, law,
and various other branches of active or speculative
science: all of which united, constitute,
even in the most opulent nations,
but a small portion of the community. We
next descend to a fertile hive of husbandmen
and artizans, laborious drudges in mechanical
trades, arts, manufactories, and
commerce: to a numerous class of retailers
or venders of merchandize, and of the necessaries
of life: to soldiers, sailors, domestick
servants: to no inconsiderable multitude
buried under ground, and occupied in digging
metals and fuel from the bowels of the
earth: to infirm, cripples, diseased, puerperal,
aged; and to many other links and gradations,
which must be greatly diversified by
the variety in governments, religion, climate,
national genius, and other causes which will
occur to philosophers, and to gentlemen
of reflection. It is of essential importance,
not only in an enlarged political, but also in
a medicinal view, to contemplate these constituent
portions of a community.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">{xxiv}</a></span></p>

<h3 class="faux" title="The inhabitants of cities, towns, and country, constitute other groups of society"></h3>

<p>The inhabitants crowded into Cities and
towns, and those dispersed in small villages,
and in the Country, constitute other large
groups of society. If the result of Susmilch’s
researches and materials, collected throughout
Germany can be depended upon as a
criterion for other European nations, the
inhabitants in the country are to those in
cities and towns as 3½ to 1. Great cities,
if we except Rome and Constantinople, are
of modern date in most kingdoms of Europe.
In the ninth century, a few towns
had been built in Germany; but in England,
corporations and considerable towns
are posterior to the Norman invasion. Cities,
associated communities, and towns, during
the religious frenzy of crusading, and
after the termination of this epidemical
distemper, were asylums from aristocratic
tyranny; and when of moderate size, are
seats of politeness, refinement, emulation,
arts, and society; but when overgrown,
they check population; they are drains of
the human species, the graves of infants,
and nurseries of vices. Unfortunately also
for succeeding generations, numerous cities,
towns, and harbours, have been founded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">{xxv}</a></span>
upon low, unhealthy situations, surrounded
by morasses and hills. Most cities seem to
have grown to maturity by accident and
time: their streets are narrow, irregular,
not sufficiently ventilated; and the inhabitants
absurdly and perniciously thronged
together. There are moderate-sized towns,
and even country districts, whose situations
are so noxious, as to make the burials exceed
the births. We need not travel to new uncultivated
continents and islands, nor to rank
tropical climates for proofs: we have only
to consult Dr. Short’s Registers of several
parts in this kingdom.</p>

<h3 class="faux" title="The human species diversified by their ages"></h3>

<p>The assemblages of the human race are
greatly diversified by their Ages. During
nine months only of uterine incubation, and
from the most minute tadpole, an infant at
birth has grown to between sixteen inches
and two feet; and from five to ten pounds
in weight. After birth, the increase is slower;
and it proceeds to shoot upwards a few
inches annually, but not always in successive
progression, and to make additions to
its weight and dimensions. Between puberty
and twenty-one years of age, man has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">{xxvi}</a></span>
generally attained to the summit of his altitude;
females, rather earlier; and those
still earlier who inhabit warm climates.
Excluding that fragment of pigmy mortals,
the Laplanders, between five and six feet in
height is the most universal and mean standard
of the human race; and their gravity in
various gradations, from eight to twenty
stone; in both which respects, females usually
fall short of males. Nature, however,
is not limited to one model of altitude or gravity;
she sometimes deviates into extravagancies,
producing human giants, from nine,
down to diminutive dwarfs of two feet; together
with shapeless monsters wallowing in
fat, and weighing upwards of forty stone.
Let us next endeavour to form arithmetical
estimates of the human race, at different
ages. Davenant calculates the inhabitants
of England (not including Scotland) at
five million and a half; and their sundry
ages as follows:—Under one year of age,
170,000; under five years of age, 820,000;
under ten years of age, 1,500,000; under
sixteen years of age, 2,240,000: from sixteen
years of age to the extreme of existence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">{xxvii}</a></span>
3,260,000; of which number he estimates
600,000, or about one ninth part of the
whole community, to have passed sixty years
of age; and of which veteran group the
males constitute 270,000; the females,
330,000. Dr. Price supposes nearly an
equal proportion living under 16, and above
that age; but that the latter are the most
numerous class: Davenant states the medium
at 20. Dr. Halley supposed the
number living under 16, to comprize about
one third of the community; and also,
that those living between 20 and 42, were
about one third of the whole. The preceding
analysis of the numbers living at
different ages in one kingdom, may with
facility be applied to any numerical extent.
If we wish to calculate the proportion living
at similar ages amongst one hundred
million, we have only to multiply by 18
each of the preceding groups composing five
million and an half of inhabitants.</p>

<h3 class="faux" title="The distinction of the sexes into male and female, form two important groups"></h3>

<p>Two large and important classes are
formed in society, by the distinction of the
Sexes into male and female. So soon as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">{xxviii}</a></span>
organs of generation are completely evolved;
that is, when the two sexes arrive at puberty,
they are inflamed with a new passion
and pleasing sense. In most warm climates,
this generative period is somewhat
earlier than in northern latitudes; and in
the former also, women are said to be
more prolifick. We shall therefore devote a
few words to the union of the sexes,
from whence ensue procreation and births.
Some calculators have computed, that amongst
five million and an half of inhabitants
in England, there are annually about
forty-one thousand legal marriages: of
which one sixth part are widows and widowers;
about one marriage to every one
hundred and four inhabitants; and the annual
marriages to the births, as 1 to 4, or
4½. The mean ages at which marriages in
this island commence, is computed from 32
to 35 on the side of the man, and 25 on that
of the woman; but in this estimate, second
and third marriages are included.</p>

<h3 class="faux" title="The comparative produce of marriages in city and country"></h3>

<p>In cities, not only fewer enter into the
matrimonial state, but the product also of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">{xxix}</a></span>
city and country-marriages is observed to
differ. Marriages in cities, one with another,
seldom produce above four; generally
between three and four, and sometimes not
three children: whereas country-marriages
seldom produce less than four, and generally
between four and five. Whether this
disparity between the product of city and
country-marriages is to be imputed to dissipation,
libertinism, and incontinence, both
in the single and married state; to the cloudy
apprehensions and fears of overstocking
their house; to later, fewer, and less frequent
unions in the matrimonial bond; or
to all these and other causes combined, I submit
to the reader’s consideration. From authentick
registers of a variety of small towns
and country parishes in England, Dr. Short
found, that each marriage produced four
and a half children, at a medium; for some
married pairs have only one or two: others
six, eight, twelve, or more; and a small remnant
are unprolifick. Natural, or illegitimate
children, are enrolled in the public records
of christenings, and swell their proportion
to the registered weddings somewhat greater<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">{xxx}</a></span>
than they would appear without this extraneous
addition. In some German registers,
Dr. Short found, that of 333,655 births,
the illegitimate amounted to one thirty-seventh
part; and in an inland town of
England, that of 10,337 births, 284, or
about one thirtieth part, were illegitimate.</p>

<h3 class="faux" title="The general proportion of births to the mortality in various kingdoms"></h3>

<p>If the number of inhabitants in any
kingdom, city, or village, continues the
same without increase or decrease, and supported
by their own procreation only, it is
evident, that there the annual births and
burials will be equal, and the supply proportioned
to the waste; and in equal numbers,
as many will die at all ages as are
born in the year, on a general average;
and the numbers dying any year at
one, two, three years of age, and so on to
the extreme of existence, will be just equal
with the numbers who successively attain
to those different ages at which the others
die. The total annual births amongst five
million and an half of inhabitants in England,
are calculated by Davenant at 190,000;
which is about one birth to every twenty-five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">{xxxi}</a></span>
inhabitants; and amongst nine million
of inhabitants in Britain and Ireland,
the annual procreation will considerably exceed
three hundred thousand; and the annual
mortality should be somewhat inferior.
In the kingdom of Prussia, from the year
1715 to 18, there were christened, at an
annual medium, 78,826; buried, 55,852.
In the kingdom of Sweden, the annual
average of births during nine years, ending
in 1763, was 90,240; burials, 69,125. In
Norway, in 1761, the christenings were
11,024; burials, 6,926. In France, during
three years, ending in 1772, the annual
average of births was 920,918; burials,
780,040. In the county district of Vaux,
in Switzerland, during ten years, the births
were 3,155; burials, 2,504. The country,
says Graunt, has 6,339 births for 5,280
burials. In that little fertile atlantic island
Madeira, the inhabitants have been computed
to double themselves in eighty-four
years; so great is the difference between
the births and burials. In some provinces
of North America, if Dr. Franklin’s calculations
are correct, the inhabitants double<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">{xxxii}</a></span>
themselves in the short space of twenty-five,
twenty-two, and even in fifteen years.
On the other hand, in all the large cities
of Europe: in Paris, Vienna, Rome, Dresden,
Berlin, Amsterdam, London, Edinburgh,
Dublin, and in almost all towns of
considerable magnitude and population, the
total annual births are inferior to the burials.
It is calculated, that in London, within
the last 150 years, near a million more of
the human species have been wasted, beyond
what were reared by its own original
growth and procreation. But in small villages
and country districts, the annual births
exceed the burials; and it is from this redundance
that a supply is furnished for
the extraordinary consumption of armies,
navies, war, colonization, emigration; exclusive
of sickness, and other morbid casualties:
the country and village surplus prevents
depopulation.</p>

<h3 class="faux" title="The comparative births of males and females"></h3>

<p>Providence has also wisely ordained, that
throughout those European kingdoms, of
which we have any registers, a few more
Males should be born than Females; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">{xxxiii}</a></span>
indeed such a surplus is rendered necessary
from the waste by wars, emigration, intemperance,
mechanical arts, and trades,
the inclemency and vicissitudes of the weather
and seasons, the vices and misfortunes
to which political punishments are annexed;
with various other noxious casualties,
to all which the male sex are most exposed.
In Dr. Arbuthnot’s Table, printed
in the <i>London Philosophical Transactions</i>, of
the proportion between the births of the
sexes; in forty-six years were baptized of
males, 329,742; of females, 308,644: excess
of males only, 21,098. By the London
bills, from 1657 to 1776, I find that there
have been christened of males, 1,041,149; of
females, 983,061, or as 18 to 17: and therefore,
that in this long interval of 120 years,
and comprehending two million of births,
there is only a trifling excess of males,
amounting to 58,088: a number which
would scarce recruit the consumption of a
few active campaigns. The excess of male
beyond female births, is not so considerable as
books of calculation have represented. In volume
the 7th of the <i>Philosophical Transactions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">{xxxiv}</a></span>
abridged</i>, there is an account of the annual
births during several years at Vienna, Breslaw,
Dresden, Leipsic, and Ratisbon: and
in those cities, male and female births were
as nineteen to eighteen.  Amongst the
abortives and stillborn, we also find the
plurality of males.  Lastly, if the registers
can be depended upon, it appears that
there are more births in Winter than in
Summer, both in town and country. But
although the fruit of the human womb
may not have arrived at maturity before
winter, it is no proof against the general
law of the spring and summer influence on
animals and vegetables, in contributing to
fecundity and generation.</p>

<p><span class="large_text uppercase">That</span> learned Physician, Dr. Arbuthnot,
in his Preface to Huygen’s “<i>de
Ratiociniis in ludo aleæ</i>”, says, There are
very few things which we know, which
are not capable of being reduced to a mathematical
reasoning; and when they cannot,
it is a sign the knowledge of them is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">{36}</a></span>
very small and confused; and, when a
mathematical reason can be had, it is as
great a folly to make use of any other, as
to grope for a thing in the dark when you
have a candle standing by you.  Medical
writers, almost universally, have neglected,
or barely skimmed the surface of the following
important subjects. The public registers
of births, burials, and diseases, are overlooked
by all the modern systematick authors:
they leave us equally ignorant of
the aggregate, or comparative number, or
force of those fiends which haunt and ravage
the globe. To speak metaphorically,
in medical books, the extensive desolation of
the most rapacious tyrants and conquerors
are confounded with the uninteresting history,
and petty depredations of a robber.
The detached observations of physicians, or
other literary individuals, confined perhaps
to a small town or parish, a meagre detail
of village remarks, furnish, in innumerable
instances, foundations too slight for the erection
and stability of general proportions. In
order to form useful tables of the ratio of
mortality at various ages, to determine upon
the absolute and relative havock by different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">{37}</a></span>
diseases, upon the general effects of climate,

new customs, and manners, &amp;c. we should
extend our views far beyond the narrow
bounds of a parish, or even of a province;
we should include an interval of many years,
collective numbers, and large groups of
mankind.</p>

<h3 class="faux" title="The primary orders of medical architecture not yet established"></h3>

<p>It appears to me, that a great number
of the fundamental principles, or of the
primary orders of medical architecture, have
not yet been established, neither in Pathology,
to which this Dissertation is chiefly
related; and much less in Therapeuticks.
The lumber and mountain of ponderous systems,
heaped together from Galen to Stahl,
can only be compared to Egyptian pyramids.
Except what has been done by a
few authors, hereafter to be mentioned, the
sciences of Medical Arithmetick and Universal
Prognosticks, are new in medicine.  In
emergencies, the constant appeal has been,
with oracular reverence, to aphorisms and
opinions of individuals. In a word, no medical
author has yet attempted to take the
gages of life and death, and of morbid devastation,
and, in one general survey, to encircle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">{38}</a></span>
the horizon of human existence and distempers.
I have made some, at least laborious efforts,
to rescue a momentous part of active
medicine from that conjectural stigma with
which the whole profession has been branded
in the lump. And, however it may be slighted
as an heretical innovation, I would strenuously
recommend Medical Arithmetick, as a guide
and compass through the labyrinth of Therapeuticks.</p>

The vision of human life is soon at an
end: we are ushered into the world with
lamentable exclamation; and are too often
torn out of it in pain and agony. Bills of
Mortality, however defective and inaccurate,
yet sufficiently demonstrate this awful truth,
that very few of the human species die of old
age, or natural decay: by far the greater proportion
are prematurely cut off by diseases.
Of all the animal tribe, who usually bring
forth one at a birth, none die in such numbers,
in infancy, as the human race.  In
London, Vienna, Berlin, and every other
overgrown metropolis of Europe, on an average,
one half of the children born, die under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">{39}</a></span>
three years of age. But in country towns
and villages, the proportion of infant mortality
greatly abates. In some country towns
of England, of considerable magnitude and
population, as Manchester, half the children
die under five; at Norwich, half under six;
at Northampton, half under ten years of age.
London, therefore, will have lost, out of
equal capitals, a number in the intermediate
space, between three and ten, more than
Northampton.</p>

<p>Attend next to the small proportion of Infant
Mortality in open country districts. By
Dr. Short’s registers of several small country
villages in England, the major part born live
to 25, 27, 33, and 40. In many healthy
country parishes, half the inhabitants born
live to mature age; to 40, 46, and a few
even to 50 and 60; and rear large families of
children. In some extensive country districts
of Switzerland, similar observations have been
made by Susmilch and Muret. Here, therefore,
is an astonishing disparity between the
duration of city and country life: but particularly,
let it be engraved upon the memory,
in the early stages of puerile exigence. Infants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">{40}</a></span>
in cities resemble tender delicate plants
excluded from fresh air; or fish confined
in stagnant putrid water: they perish before
acquiring a solidity and seasoning to endure
the adulterated quality of the surrounding
element; and their thread of life is then
suspended by a tender cobweb.</p>

<p>Mortality, universally, during the first year
after birth, is the most enormous in the
funeral catalogue. A London infant at birth,
has but an equal chance of living to three
years old; whereas in the country, as before
observed, half born survive to maturity.
Upon reaching the third year, in cities,
infants are somewhat seasoned, and the hurricane
of puerile carnage is greatly abated.
There is not afterwards such a prodigious disproportion
between city and country mortality;
and, in a few years after, from seven to
ten, they approach nearer to an equality.
From the London registers of burials, it appears
that more die in the metropolis under
two years of age, than from two to upwards
of forty; and more under five years of age,
than from five to between fifty and sixty:
yet under five, there are but an inconsiderable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">{41}</a></span>
number alive, compared to the latter class
above that age: the deaths are greatly disproportioned
to the living numbers or capitals.
A few more die in the short interval
between five and ten years of age, than in the
succeeding double interval from ten to twenty.
Between eight and sixteen years of age, one
of every seventy of the Christ School boys
is computed to die. Davenant rates the
decrement in these years at only one <i>per
cent.</i> After reaching the tenth year, the torrent
of mortality in city, town, and country,
is subsided; and during the next eight or ten
years of adolescence, very few die. From seven
to ten, may be termed the highest pinnacle:
having surmounted all the dangers and
precipices of the early preceding journey, there
is no stage wherein the future prospects of
existence and longevity are so extensive. From
birth to ten, the tide of life continues in
annual gradation to increase; and from ten
to the ultimate verge of existence, vitality
continues gradually to ebb. Between twenty
and thirty, more die in London than in the
fifteen preceding years; and the burial list
continues turgid to sixty; at which latter
stage, the mortality is computed between four
and five <i>per <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">{42}</a></span>cent.</i></p>

<p>One reason, but not the only one, as I
shall hereafter prove, of the great surge in
the London bills, from twenty up to forty,
is, that within this interval of life, the
majority of the new settlers or recruits, arrive;
and consequently augment the burials,
from twenty to forty, beyond their natural
proportion. After passing the meridian,
and in the evening of life, the seasoned
inhabitants of cities are said by Dr. Price, to
have the advantage of the country, in health
and longevity: that is to say, although the
number who have survived in the country to
sixty, seventy, and eighty, are greater proportionally
than in cities, yet the latter class
arrived at those years in London, have, comparatively,
surer expectations of life. I do not,
however, find this assertion verified in fact;
the balance, if any, vibrating alternately on
each side. The proportion of inhabitants who
reach eighty years of age are computed, in
London and Vienna, at one of every forty:
but in country parishes, at one of every
twenty-two; and in some, even one of every
eleven. In both city and country, the few
survivors at ninety, out of each thousand cœtaneous
births, will have lost almost all their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">{43}</a></span>
fellow-travellers in the journey, long before
reaching that goal; and about three or four
only out of each thousand, on an average, will
be then left alive.</p>

<h3 class="faux" title="Of longevity"></h3>

<p>There are a few instances of extraordinary
Longevity, to 150 and 165; such are
Jenkins and Par, in this island. In Bacon
Lord Verulam’s History of Long Livers,
male and female; their climate, diet, mode
of life, appetites, exercises, studies, passions,
dispositions, habits, and complexions, were
exceedingly dissimilar. It is however probable,
from observation and analogy, that the
indigent and laborious class of mankind do
not attain to longevity in the same proportion
with the middling and more opulent ranks.
The wandering Savages of America are notoriously
short-lived. Throughout Europe,
Asia, Africa, and America, the rich, the poor,
the inhabitants of city and country, with very
different complexion, climate, soil, diet, and
conveniences, all seldom exceed the usual term
of life allotted to man: seventy and eighty is
mentioned in holy writ, as the brink of our
earthly duration. Since the days of Moses;
that is, between three and four thousand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">{44}</a></span>
years, human existence has been circumscribed
within the same narrow bounds. In
the London registers of mortality, during a
period of thirty years, from 1728 to 1758,
the total mortality is 750,332; and of all
this number, 242 only reached beyond 100
years of age; one of whom arrived at 138.
In some races and families of men, longevity
seems to be hereditary; and his age, though
little more than a dream, exceeds that of all
other living creatures, a few only excepted.
Amongst the quadruped creation, the elephant
surpasses man in longevity: amongst
the birds, the Swan, and a few others, have
survived upwards of a century. The age
of fishes is determined with more ingenuity
than certainty: some seem to rival man in
years. Among the numerous vegetable tribes,
the Oak, Chestnut, and some other great trees,
survive centuries.</p>

<h3 class="faux" title="Comparative mortality of males and females"></h3>

<p>On contrasting the mortality of Males and
Females, it appears, that, notwithstanding the
surplus of male births, the perils of childbearing,
the many vexatious diseases peculiar
to the fair sex, and that physicians and apothecaries
have many more patients of the latter;
yet the total aggregate number of living<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">{45}</a></span>
females exceeds that of males, in most European
kingdoms. Upon a numerical inquest
in Edinburgh, and some other great cities, it
was found, that females were to males as
4 to 3: in London, as 13 to 10; and in
some other cities and towns, as 9 to 8. But
in country districts, Graunt and Susmilch
agree, that the two sexes approach nearer to
an equality. In the province of Jersey, in
North America, the males were found the
majority. From 1702 to 1752; that is,
during a period of fifty years, I find the proportion
of male and female mortality in London
as follows: Male deaths, 618,076; Female
deaths, 626,692. Whence, therefore,
does it happen, that female deaths preponderate
over the male, when more of the latter
are born, and, as calculators assert, the mortality
of males, at all ages, is greater than
that of females? As a solution of this difficulty
and partial exception, I should suggest a
greater exportation and transportation of males
to the sea and land service, to nautical commerce,
and to unhealthy climates.</p>

<h3 class="faux" title="Comparative mortality of husband and wife"></h3>

<p>Even in the Marriage State, the chance of
survivorship seems considerably in favour of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">{46}</a></span>
the wife. In Breslaw, during eight years,
five married men died to three married
women. Susmilch, on a scrutiny through
several kingdoms and principalities of Germany,
found, that three married men died to
two married women. Dr. Price estimates
the chance in favour of the wife being the
survivor in marriage, as 3 to 2: and this calculation
is confirmed by the experience of the
general Clerical Society in Scotland, who have
long established funds to support their widows.
From their records, it appears that twenty
married clergymen have died to twelve wives;
or, as 5 to 3. By an accurate survey of several
principalities and cities in Germany, and
collected by Susmilch, the widows were to
the widowers as 3, and even 4 to 1. At marriage,
it should be observed, there is generally
a disparity of age; the bridegroom is from six
to twelve years older than the bride; and therefore
should, in the course of nature, die sooner:
and perhaps also more widowers, comparatively
with the other sex, enter into a second
marriage; which tends to reduce their numbers.
Besides, husbands are more exposed to
the vicissitudes of the weather and seasons, to
excessive labour and noxious trades, and to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">{47}</a></span>
many other causes of diseases. Dr. Price finds,
that the sexes respectively commence to be
widowers and widows about 52 and 44; that
is, men and women entering into matrimony,
on a general average, at the age of 33 and 25,
will become widowers and widows at 52 and
44: consequently, that each marriage will be
dissolved by the death of one of them, in nineteen
years; which is the ultimate term and
probability of the husband and wife being both
alive. For although some marriages may be
protracted forty and fifty years, yet others may
be dissolved in one year, or in a shorter
time.</p>

<h3 class="faux" title="Comparative longevity in the married and single state"></h3>

<p>We have not yet sufficient information
to determine the comparative chances of Female
Longevity in the married and single
state. At Berlin, indeed, calculators have
remarked, that there were more married
women alive at great ages, than of those
who remained single. But such result might
naturally be expected from a greater proportion
in the decline of life of widows and
wives, compared to antiquated virgins. From
the ages of fifteen to twenty-five, married
women likewise are said to have the advantage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">{48}</a></span>
of the single, in whom the dictates of nature
are frustrated and violated.</p>

<h3 class="faux" title="Comparative mortality of the seasons"></h3>

<p>Comparing the mortality of the Seasons,
Dr. Short found, from a variety of country-registers,
that mortality generally begins its
reign in December; that at March it is in
its zenith; and at May in its declension. In
twenty-five country towns and parishes, he
found the winter to the summer mortality
as 50 to 41. At Manchester, a country town
of England, Dr. Percival found the winter
to the summer mortality as 11 to 8. At
Vevey, in Switzerland, during sixty years,
Mr. Muret found the burials, during the four
winter months, as 5 to 4 to those of the summer.
Another proof of this is recorded in the
<i>Recherches sur la Population, par Messance</i>:
The total sick admitted into the <i>Hotel Dieu</i>
hospital in Paris, from 1724 to 1763 (forty
years) were, in the four winter months, December,
January, February, and March,
314,824; and in the four summer months,
June, July, August, September, 238,522;
or as 4 to 3. In London too, the undertaker’s,
harvest is in winter. There is one
obvious reason why, in every metropolis, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">{49}</a></span>
winter mortality should exceed that of summer,
from the greater concourse of inhabitants
of all ranks: but, independent of additional
population in winter, the same law
seems to prevail in country places. In a
subsequent part I shall attempt to throw
some collateral illustration upon the subject.</p>

<h3 class="faux" title="A general abstract of human mortality in city and country, and throughout the globe"></h3>

<p>Let us close this humiliating scene with
a general abstract of human carnage. If
we scan the dolorous mansions of disease, we
find, on an average, 1 death, annually, out
of every 5 families in cities: but in country
towns, and open districts, 1 of 7, 8, 9; and
in a few healthy places, 1 of every 10 families.
Including the whole assemblage
of inhabitants in city, town, and country,
from birth to the extreme of existence, they
are computed to die in the following annual
proportion to the living: In London,
1 of 21; Dublin, 1 of 22; Edinburgh, 1 of
21; Vienna, 1 of 20; Amsterdam, 1 of 22;
Berlin, 1 of 26. This is nearly Dr. Price’s
calculation; but Halley and Susmilch compute
only 1 of 22 to 29 to die annually in
cities. In smaller cities and towns, such
as Norwich and Northampton, the general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">{50}</a></span>
average of deaths is 1 of 24 to 26; but
in several provinces and healthy country
villages, 1 of 32 and 33, up to 45, 50, and
even 60, is the annual drain: 1 of 43 to 50
was the average in upwards of a thousand
country parishes on the continent; and recorded
in Susmilch. Within the above
short intervals of time, there will have died
in the respective cities and country places
enumerated, a number equal to the whole
inhabitants. But the annual decrease of the
oppressed Negroes, in the West India islands,
is estimated at 1 of 7.</p>

<p>The ancient Egyptians allotted 3 generations
to a century, which is bordering upon
the truth; at this day, 1 of 32 and 33 up to
35, is near the measure of a generation, and to
the general decrease of a community throughout
Europe, comprehending all the inhabitants
in city, village, and country: that is,
mankind share amongst them from about
32 and 33 to 35 years each of existence:
and within this fugitive interval of time, a
number equal to all the present inhabitants
of this island, or of the whole earth, will
be exterminated.  If we extend this estimate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">{51}</a></span>
to the whole human race, eight hundred
million will die in 33 years; about
twenty-eight million annually; seventy or
eighty thousand daily; about three thousand
hourly; and from fifty to sixty every
minute.  It is perhaps superfluous to add,
that, in the same intervals, an equal or superior
number will be born.</p>

<h3 class="faux" title="The probabilities or expectation of life"></h3>

<p>According to De Moivre and Dr. Price,
“the probabilities or expectation of life, decrease
as we advance from childhood to
old age, in an arithmetical progression;
that is, in such a manner that the difference
is always the same between the
number of persons living at the beginning
of any one year, and the number
living at the beginning of the following
year.” Or, in other words, less enveloped
in mathematical obscurity, out of any
specified number, an hundred or a thousand,
the same proportion will continue to die
every year until near 80 years of age and
upwards: consequently, the probabilities of
life are constantly decreasing; because notwithstanding
the progressive annual drain
from the capitals, yet the deaths continue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">{52}</a></span>
throughout equal. But this proportion is
certainly erroneous in the first stages of life,
and until about 10. View the above proposition
in another light.</p>

<p>From any given number there will be an
equal drain annually, until what De Moivre
terms the <i>complement</i> or <i>maximum</i>, or utmost
probable extreme of life, which he fixes at
86, all are dead. The probability, therefore,
that the whole of any limited number
whatsoever, or age, will all be exterminated
is the number of years between 86
and the year such a number are all alive.
Of 56 persons alive at 30, they should all be
dead in 56 years, because 56 added to 30
amounts to 86, the maximum: of 46 persons
alive at 40 years of age, they should
all be dead in 46 years: and 36 persons
alive at 50 years of age, should be dead in
36 years; for 50 and 36 complete the
maximum. Again, the expectation of any
single life is only half the maximum or
complement, or half the space between
that age and the ultimate term of existence:
but here we must repeat the former
exception, and draw the line after 10<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">{53}</a></span>
years of age. The expectation of two
equal joint lives, according to De Moivre,
is one third of the complement of life. Example:
two lives, aged 40, have an even
chance or probable prospect of continuing
together in exigence only 15 years; which
is the third of the complement, reckoning
from 40 to 86: the expectation of the
survivor is also 15. Or, suppose a lot of
marriages of persons at 40 years of age,
they will, on an average, continue together
15½ years; and the survivors the same time
after. This expectation, therefore, is the probable
duration of each marriage, and the
share of each person’s life. But it may
be proper to add, that the duration of marriages,
and the value of single and joint
lives, will, on a promiscuous calculation,
be different from the registers of annuitant
and insurance offices; because they
are scrupulously vigilant to exclude all diseased
and unhealthy persons from becoming
members.</p>

<p>The following Chart and Tables, present
a distinct prospect of the fates clipping the
mortal thread, from birth to old age, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">{54}</a></span>
city and country. But we are not to suppose
that in every instance there will be
annually a regular arithmetical diminution,
as marked in the different tables: some
years will be more fatal than others; and
we are to form estimates from an average
of several years.  The first column points
out the age, the second the number living
at that age, the third the number who
die during the year; and so on to the end
of the table.  But observe, that the number
of infants, at the beginning of the second
column, are supposed to be all born
together on the first day of that year; and
this rule applies throughout all the remaining
ages. The two short tables of 15
and 30 years mortality in London, demonstrate
the gradations at longer intervals than
a single year.  From these different tables
may be estimated the annual waste, out of
any specified number, at all ages, the ultimate
prospects of existence, and the odds or
probability of a person in health surviving
a stated number of years.</p>

<h3 class="faux" title="Of the mortality by different diseases"></h3>

<p>Having in the preceding part endeavoured
to establish the mortality of the
human species at different ages, I am now
to attempt a more arduous task; to ascertain
the mortality by different diseases.  I
propose therefore, in imitation of the geographers,
to spread out and to review, in
one general Chart, the enormous host of
diseases which disgorge their virulence over
the earth, and, with frightful rapacity, wage
incessant hostilities with mankind. By this
means, we shall, to use a military phrase,
reconnoitre more distinctly our enemies arranged
in hostile front; and be warned to
make the best disposition and preparation for
defence where the greatest danger is apprehended,
and the most formidable assaults
to be sustained. Armed with diseases, the
grim King of Terrors appears in the most
hideous aspect.  Under all these predatory
disguises and morbifick forms, I shall track
him grappling with mankind, and with
his tremendous scythe mowing down generations.
The learned Sauvages thus expresses
himself: “Utinam numerus respectivus
diversorum morborum a nostratibus
inquirarentur.” It is, in some measure,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">{57}</a></span>
from ignorance in this subject, that
the streams of medical inquiries, of academick
rudiments, and of charitable donations
to poverty in disease, have not yet been pointedly
directed to publick utility.</p>

<h3 class="faux" title="Of the London bills of mortality"></h3>

<p>I could easily have exhibited tables of
the Diseases and Casualties in London during
the greater part of the last century.
But, compared to its present magnitude,
the British metropolis was then insignificant
in size: 23 new parishes have been
since gradually added to the London bills:
there is also a chasm of 10 years in which
the registers are lost. Again, until 1665
and 6, London was infested with the plague;
which disease, previous to that date, seems
to have been one primary object of the registers:
and to adopt Graunt and Short’s
sentiments, these records, from various political
and religious obstacles, were then
very negligently managed. During the
early part of this interval, the kingdom
was distracted with civil war; and after
the great pestilence in 1665, London must
have required some years to recruit. Besides,
had I attempted to form tables for even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">{58}</a></span>
the latter part of the last century, the reader
would have been fruitlesly embarrassed; and
such an attempt must ever prove abortive.
For example, under one and the same title,
in the annual bills of mortality, are often
confounded flox, small pox, and measles:
consumptions and tissick: cancer, canker,
and thrush: wolf, cancer, gangrene, and fistula:
cancer, gangrene, fistula, and mortification:
gout and sciatica: vapours and
water in the head: quinsey and thrush:
teeth and worms: sores, ulcers, bruised and
broken limbs: cough, cold, and chincough,
&amp;c. These are a few specimens of Nosological
absurdity in the superintendents of the
publick registers.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this rabble of diseases in
commenting upon the London bills and
diseases of the present century, I constantly
refer back, and contrast them with the bills
of the last thirty years of the preceding
century; so that, as near as the imperfection
of the materials will admit, the mortality
and diseases of 105 years in London
is presented at one view; and comprehends
the various acute and chronic diseases,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">{59}</a></span>
by which about two million and a
half of the human species have been destroyed.
The few authors who have written
on bills of mortality, have obscured
their works in a cloud of figures and calculation:
the reader must have no small
portion of phlegm and resolution to follow
them throughout with attention: they
often tax the memory and patience with a
numerical superfluity, even to a nuisance.</p>

<h3 class="faux" title="The chart of London diseases may serve as a general
scale and index of diseases and casualties to Britain and Ireland, or to
the whole globe; with exceptions: a sort of medical geometry and trigonometry"></h3>

<p>For the above, and many other reasons,
I have compressed into one chart, the London
Diseases and Casualties of seventy-five
years in the present century: each disease
and casualty arranged in a progressive series
of fifteen years mortality; in a fifth
column is added together the mortality of
the preceding five divisions.  During this
period, London has been more populous
and stationary in numbers: and by this
means, the actual and comparative magnitude,
rise, and declension of different diseases,
will be more conspicuous in each period
or interval: and by measuring the mortality
with the population, we are enabled,
with certain precautions and exceptions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">{60}</a></span>
to make the diseases and casualties of London
serve as a morbid barometer to the
whole nation. The important reason which
determined me in forming an arrangement
of fifteen years, in preference to any other
number or period, was, that the annual
havock by similar diseases and casualties,
throughout this and the neighbouring island,
might be computed with some probability
by each fifteen years of the London bills;
and thereby to elicite a new, curious, and
comprehensive proportion in medicine. For
instance, if we suppose the standing number,
on an average, of the London inhabitants
at six hundred thousand; and the
total inhabitants in Britain and Ireland at
nine million; and if the same diseases and
casualties were equally diffused and fatal to
this whole community, then, in such case,
the London bills would serve as a scale
or index of mortality to both kingdoms:
as many would die annually of every disease
and casualty throughout nine million, as
are cut off in fifteen years in London; for
six hundred thousand multiplied by fifteen,
amounts to nine million.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">{61}</a></span></p>

<p>But to supply the probable deficiency in
the annual mortality of London by different
diseases and casualties, we must make
an addition to each of one third or fourth.
To the mortality of Small-Pox, in London,
during fifteen years, and rated at thirty
thousand, we should add one third or
fourth more to raise it to its just standard;
that is, to about thirty-eight thousand;
which would be the annual mortality
amongst nine million in Britain and
Ireland, supposing small-pox equally universal,
one time or other, and destructive.
By the same hypothesis, amongst two hundred
million in Europe Variolous mortality
annually, would amount to four hundred
thousand; and, amongst eight hundred million;
that is, the whole human race would
exceed three million annually. On this simple
principle, a gross estimate may be
formed of the annual havock by every other
disease and casualty; taking the precaution,
however, to attend to the subsequent
criticisms on the London bills.</p>

<p>Another curious corollary may be grounded
on the above hypothesis; which is, to form a
probable conjecture of the numbers who are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">{62}</a></span>
annually Sick, or afflicted with different diseases.
Example: if one of every seven die
of the Small Pox, and the variolous deaths
throughout Britain and Ireland are rated
at thirty-eight thousand annually, this number,
multiplied by seven, amounts to two
hundred and sixty-six thousand annually,
infected with variolous contagion. Apply
the same rule to Childbed mortality; rate
the annual havock by parturition in the
two islands at four thousand: it will hereafter
be shewn, that in London one of
seventy-four women die in childbed: multiply
therefore 4,000 by 74, the product
is 296,000, which, in reality, cannot be
very distant from the total annual procreation
in both islands. And in these two
examples, I have suggested what may be
termed an inverse proof of both propositions.
From these tables and commentaries,
we are likewise furnished with a
key to the comparative mortality of each
disease amongst a community: whether its
devastation is in the proportion of a fifth,
tenth, twentieth, or hundredth. Gentlemen
who have not particularly attended to the
subject of morbid calculations (and very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">{63}</a></span>
few of the medical profession have) will,
on better information, be astonished at the
flagrant errors daily committed by authors
when treating of these topicks. Out of
the many examples which might be enumerated,
I shall merely select one in proof.
Baron Dimsdale, in a Treatise on Inoculation,
dedicated to the present Empress of
Russia, calculated that, at least, two million
were annually destroyed by Small Pox alone
in the Russian empire; and it was not
until after the publication of my Observations
on his different Inoculating Essays,
that this error and others were erased.</p>

<h3 class="faux" title="The number and proportion of diseases not to be estimated by the mortality of each"></h3>

<p>I would request the reader’s particular
attention to another circumstance: which
is, that on comparing the gradations of
mortality in the following chart, we are
not to estimate the relative number, frequency,
or proportion of certain diseases,
compared to others by the absolute mortality
of each. For instance, Apoplexy kills
rather more annually in London than Measles;
but yet the latter disease is infinitely
more universal and diffused amongst the
community, and consequently less dangerous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">{64}</a></span>
to life: Cancerous and Venereal cases
are widely different in the annual number
afflicted with each, although the deaths
are not far distant from an equality. The
same observations will apply to Rheumatism,
compared to the Dropsy, and to many other
diseases.</p>

<p>There are between eighty and ninety
diseases and casualties enumerated in the
London bills, which, in the subsequent comments,
I have disentangled into their separate
genera. But, to prevent the possibility
of aberration, after the chart of London
diseases, I have added a correct Medical
Chart of all the principal diseases and
casualties with which mankind, in every
part of the earth and ocean, are afflicted
or harrassed. This will operate as a check
and correction to the public registers; and
by this, the defects and errors in the London
bills will be apparent; and it will
serve as an index to our future commentaries.
But objections and difficulties occur
in our researches for collateral information
and illustration from hospital records. The
reasons are glaring, why, in the latter, diseases<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">{65}</a></span>
should be less fatal; and in this respect,
cities should have the advantage of
the country. We cannot therefore apply
hospital registers as a general criterion to
a nation. Whenever authentic and systematic
records of diseases, recovery, and mortality,
are kept in hospitals, domestick as
well as military, and annually published,
whatever may be alledged respecting the
importance and demerits of such institutions,
the community, at all events, will
derive much useful information.</p>

<p>The Poet has, in just and emphatical
language, stiled health the vital principle
of bliss. In the rude state of science
and medicine, and in the ages of superstition
and credulity, it was usual to
ascribe diseases to the immediate resentment
of some invisible demon, or to divine
displeasure and chastisement; on which
account, in barbarous nations, their physicians
have been a set of stupid conjurors.
Two centuries have barely elapsed,
since the people of England could, with
difficulty, be persuaded that the jail distemper,
communicated at the Oxford assizes,
from the prisoners to the spectators,
was not kindled up by witchcraft and necromancy:
but learning and philosophy
have now discarded such supernatural agents.
Others again equally err, in supposing diseases
to be unsteady motions of the human
machine, excited by something hurtful.
This popular error seems to originate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">{70}</a></span>
from confounding diseases themselves
with the versatility of medical remedies
and practice. Beyond a doubt, diseases are
presented to us, over and over again, in
nearly the same form and shape: the diseases
delineated two thousand years ago by
Hippocrates, at this day retain the same
essential marks and prominent features; tho’
in degree and violence, there are many gradations
and shades to vary the picture.</p>

<h3 class="faux" title="Of diseases in general"></h3>

<p>A disease, in the pathological language,
is when one or more of the various corporeal
or mental functions, cannot be performed
as in usual health. The symptoms
of all diseases are indicated by few or many
derangements of the corporeal functions,
of the excretions, and of the sensible qualities:
such are pain, disagreeable sensation,
anxiety, irritation internal or external; the
exercise of some of the external or internal
senses impeded; of sleep and waking;
of the muscular or moving fibres; of the
digestive and intestinal functions: of the
lacteal, lymphatic, or absorbent system; of
the respiration, sanguiferous circulation, and
arterial pulsation; of the different excretions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">{71}</a></span>
and secretions, the feces, urine, perspiration,
bile, pancreatic fluid, saliva, milk,
menses, semen, mucus, oil, lymph, by extravasated
blood: by the countenance, actions,
gestures, debility, strength, heat, colour,
smell, taste, magnitude, hardness, softness,
the nature and appearance of the excretions,
&amp;c. I studiously avoid all minute
pathological discrimination of symptoms;
as symptoms of the disease, of the cause,
of symptoms, of reacting nature; of primary,
pathognomic, accidental, and accessary symptoms.
Nor in briefly enumerating the various
causes of diseases, shall I waste time
in the explanation of what may be learned
from pathological systems and vocabularies:
such as the technical distinction of
causes into external and internal, predisponent,
exciting and occasional, remote and
proximate.</p>

<h3 class="faux" title="Of the fatal epidemicks in England during two centuries; and comparison of sickly years in city and country"></h3>

<p>There is both fiction and much truth in
the warbling melody of the Roman poet:
“Post ignem etherea domo subductum
macies, et nova febrium cohors incubuit
terris.” Consumptions and Fevers
we see, by arithmetical demonstration, are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">{72}</a></span>
amongst the most universal and fatal maladies
of our metropolis and Island. I begin
this morbid survey with the latter.
The principal and most general febrile epidemicks
which infested England during two
intire centuries, are enumerated in a short
abstract, by Dr. Short; and consist of plagues,
agues, remittent fevers, summer and autumnal
dysenteries, spotted putrid fevers,
slow fevers, small pox, measles, putrid and
contagious peripneumonies, fatal spring pleurisies,
and peripneumonies, and epidemical
catarrhs.  Throughout all countries, in
epidemical diseases, there are years when
they are more or less prevalent. Great
national calamities, from this source, are
rare: none ever inundate a whole kingdom
(catarrh in some instances excepted):
they sometimes indeed spread from one province
to another, but all the community
are never attacked at once; nor are large
populous kingdoms, or even cities, totally
exempt from them. Fevers of various generic
forms, as intermittent, remittent, nervous
and putrid, scarlet, small-pox, measles,
&amp;c. may be local and circumscribed to one
city or district, whilst others in the vicinity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">{73}</a></span>
continue at the same time healthy;
the disease dissipating its virulence within
a small boundary.  From a comparison of
150 different parish registers, Dr. Short calculates,
that within a certain period, some
have had 8 to 14 sickly years, and others,
in the same interval, only one. He estimates
5, 6, and 8 years interval, as a common
rotine of irruption by some epidemical
distemper, even in remote country parishes:
and a few of them have been so fortunate as
to escape any uncommon or remarkable
mortality during 11, 12, or even 20 and 30
years. In all the seasons denominated sickly
in the country parishes, the burials exceeded
the christenings; and according to the nature
of the epidemick, the morbid state of
the seasons, the medical treatment, and
many other circumstances, the gradations
of mortality, even by the same disease, were
extremely various.</p>

<p>Collating the annual average of deaths in
a sickly year of London, and other great
cities, with sickly years in the country parishes,
Dr. Short found, that cities and towns,
in this respect, have the advantage of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">{74}</a></span>
country. In spacious open country districts
where fatal epidemicks burst out,
according to this author, more died in one
year than during 6, 10, 12, or sometimes
15 healthy years: whereas, says he, in
London, and such other cities, not above
one third, fourth, or fifth beyond the ordinary
consumption are swept away. Pestilential
mortality is a solitary exception to this
proportion. In the London bills we may frequently
observe, that in different months,
the deaths are double or treble above equal
periods of the same year: but during the
present century, I find no instance of triple,
very rarely of double excess in the annual
London burials. Dr. Short adds, that
mortality is more constant and regular in
cities, and not so many destroyed “per saltum”
from raging epidemicks, as in the
country. In pure open air, he suggests,
that contagion and infection, or other adulterated
effluvia, are more virulent. Or
perhaps he should have said, or at least have
added, that in cities where the atmosphere
is charged with a load of smoke, and other
heterogeneous vapours, epidemical poisons
may be blunted, decompounded, or annihilated;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">{75}</a></span>
that likewise in cities, human bodies
are more early seasoned and habituated
to such noxious external impressions, and,
like doctors and nurses, are in some degree
fortified by habit: that besides, in every
large metropolis, small-pox, measles, and,
some other febrile epidemicks, are almost
constant residents; and consequently the devaluation
from these diseases is more regular
and equal than in the country, where
several years intervene between their invasions.</p>

<h3 class="faux" title="Of fevers"></h3>

<p>The absolute mortality by fevers in the
London bills, without including the small
pox and measles, amounts to nearly one seventh
of the whole funeral catalogue. In
the London dispensaries, the Aldersgate and
Westminster, and in the Newcastle hospital,
fevers were a fourth and sixth to all
other diseases. De Haen computes, that
out of two thousand sick, admitted into the
hospitals in Vienna, seven hundred of them
laboured under acute and febrile diseases.
Dr. Cleghorn estimates the summer fevers
in that warm Mediterranean island Minorca,
as constituting three-fourths of all the diseases<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">{76}</a></span>
in that island. Dr. Lind calculates,
that nineteen out of twenty of all the numerous
Europeans who visit the sultry climates
of Africa, America, and of the East
and West Indies, are destroyed by intermittent,
remittent fevers, and fluxes; and
probably he also should have added, or by
chronic diseases and broken constitutions,
the consequence of those fevers. In the
London bills of mortality, many different
genera of fevers are crammed into one indiscriminate
heap, from which it is impossible
to extricate the specific nature or genus
of febrile carnage. I was anxious to determine
with some probability, the ratio of desolation
in London, by each of the different
febrile genera: because it would be an important
guide to the prevention and cure. I
knew that most of our hospital registers were
in this particularly defective; on that account
I was favoured by a medical friend,
with the perusal of the books of the Aldersgate
dispensary. But although no gentlemen
are better qualified to discriminate
diseases, I perceived, on inspection, that too
often the genus of fevers was not marked,
only by the general outlines of the class.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">{77}</a></span>
However, I converted this scrutiny to some
other use, as will hereafter appear.</p>

<p>We shall first trace the prominent features
of the general febrile Class, descending
progressively through the different Orders
and Genera. In most fevers, of whatsoever
genus, one or more of the following
symptoms occur: shivering, chilliness, and
heat of the skin alternating: the circulation
of the blood, and consequently of the
pulse, as felt at the wrist, accelerated more
than in the natural state; in adults, to upwards
of 96 strokes every minute; and in
infants, is considerably more increased in
velocity: also general languor, lassitude, and
debility of the nerves and muscles; dryness
of the mouth and tongue, thirst;
little or no sleep, or disturbed and not refreshing,
and generally headach: in most of
the continued and remittent fevers, there is
total suspension of appetite, sickness at the
stomach, nausea and vomiting; increased
heat of the skin, at least burning sensation;
aversion to motion; the sick are mostly
confined to bed, unable to walk, or frequently
even to sit erect; and this is commonly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">{78}</a></span>
the case, even in the intermittent
genera during the febrile paroxism: the
remittent and continued have usually an
evening or nocturnal febrile exacerbation:
the voice and countenance frequently express
condolence: and in the genera of topical inflammations,
there is fixed pain in the different
parts affected.</p>

<h3 class="header"><i>Intermittent Fevers</i>,</h3> <p class="header">or Agues, notwithstanding
their febrile type, fall under the
Chronic class. They are usually distinguished
into different genera, or types; into
Quotidian, Tertian, Quartan, with their separate
species and varieties. It would seem,
by the London registers, that very few die
of agues, from which no age is exempted,
but to which adults are much more obnoxious.
Intermittent havock, if not immediately,
yet in its chronic effects, is far more
fatal than the London bills represent. Towns
in general, it is true, are less harrassed with
agues than country places. Pringle remarks,
that during the campaigns of the British
troops in the marshy countries of Holland
and Flanders, where, in all such climates,
and in damp soils and situations, agues and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">{79}</a></span>
remittent fevers are epidemick, that the
soldiers quartered in towns were less afflicted
than those stationed in country cantonments:
that in the former, the fires, sewers,
drains, and paved streets, prevented an exuberance
of moisture: and that, if the men
slept in the upper floors of the house, they
were still more secure from damp and intermittent
sickness.</p>

<p>The invasion of Intermittent Paroxisms, is
during certain periods only, and generally
consists of a successive series of shivering
and cold, burning heat, and profuse sweats:
and exhibits the fundamental outlines of all
fevers. Intermittent paroxisms, and consequently
the genera and species, vary in duration,
in recurrence, and in the symptoms.
Quotidians, Tertians, and Quartans, consist
of paroxisms, at the respective intervals of
24, 48, and 72 hours. An interval denotes
the length of time from the beginning of
one paroxism to the next succeeding: an
intermission the vacation between paroxisms.
Other distinctions, perhaps too refined, are
made of intermittents, as Quintanæ, Septiminæ,
Decimanæ, Erraticæ, Vagæ. Each of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">{80}</a></span>
three primary intermittent genera, are likewise
subdivided into duplex and triplex. The
double tertian is a very universal form, but
may be referred to remittents: it implies
that every other or second day the paroxisms
are similar, but different in the intermediate
days. Again, the type of intermittents
is often obscured under a cloud of
irregular and adventitious symptoms; and
from one predominant symptom, or from similarity
to various other diseases, these three
fundamental genera are split by Nosologists
into other species and varieties; the Quotidiana
or intermittens, into simplex, cephalalgia,
ophthalmica, nephralgica, stranguriosa,
ischiadica, sputatoria, catarrhalis,
anginosa, epileptica, hysterica, partialis: the
Tertiana into simplex, hemitritæa, duplex,
triplex, pleuritica, asthmatica, arthritica,
emetica, hysterica, apoplectica, urticata, and
other species of double tertian enumerated
under the remittent type: the Quartana
into cataleptica, epileptica, hysterica, maniaca,
comatosa, nephralgica, splenetica, arthritica.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">{81}</a></span></p>

<p>The three stages of intermittent fevers,
during their periodical revolution, affect, more
or less, the brain and nerves, the inherent
muscular power, the heart and arteries, the
stomach and intestines, and the sensible
qualities of the body; the symptoms usually
succeeding in the following progressive
order: languor, sluggishness, debility, impaired
sensibility, sometimes drowsiness and
coma, oscitation, sensation of coldness in the
back and spine, overspreading the body and
extremities; accelerated and weak pulse;
laborious respiration with anxiety; impaired
appetite, and often sickness, nausea, and
vomiting of bile; thirst; limpid urine;
pale face, extremities, and trunk, and cutaneous
collapse; rigor and trembling of
the extremities and trunk, and gnashing
of the teeth, as if cold water was poured
on the body. This stage is various in duration
in different persons, and in the different
intermittent types. Nature at length
rallies its powers with success, and with
the expulsion of the cold, the second or
hot stage is kindled up with undulating
flushes of heat, and its preternatural increase
over the body; the cutaneous blood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">{82}</a></span>
vessels are dilated with suffusion of the
countenance, redness, and burning heat; the
pulse becomes strong, full, and more regular;
the respiration continues oppressed, and is
accelerated; with headach, throbbing of
the temporal arteries, and sometimes delirium.
After some continuance of this
febrile struggle, and tumultuary rage of
the re-acting organs of sensation and motion,
the third stage of sweat is introduced
by some moisture oozing throughout
all the cutaneous pores, and poured out often
in profuse streams: with this the heat
of the body, the pulse, respiration and appetite
become more natural; the urine less
transparent deposits a sediment; the febrile
tempest abates to a calm; and the body recovers
the exercise of all its usual functions.
Sometimes indeed there are varieties; such
as little or no cold stage, or sweat.</p>

<p>Intermittent paroxisms are always terminated
in less than twenty-four hours.
Quotidians have the least cold stage, but
the longest paroxism: tertians are in the
intermediate degree in both respects; quartans
have the most violent, or at least the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">{83}</a></span>
longest cold stage, but the shortest paroxism:
their cold stage may be two hours,
or longer. The hot and sweating stages
therefore constitute the greatest portion of
intermittent conflict. Quotidian paroxisms
rarely exceed eighteen hours: tertians are
from six to twelve: quartans somewhat shorter.
Quotidians generally assault in the morning;
tertians and quartans in the noon and
afternoon. Vernal are said not to be so refractory
as autumnal intermittents. But in
young sound constitutions, agues, if not inveterate,
are frequently cured after a few paroxisms.
When death happens in them, it is
generally during the cold stage. More frequently
their fatality is by transition into
some other chronic diseases: such as maladies
of the stomach, digestive organs, liver, and
intestinal tube; bilious cachexy, jaundice,
consumptions, dropsy. Some inveterate corporeal
infirmities have been relieved by intermittents.
During their revolution the
type is frequently changed: quartan and
tertian into quotidian: the latter into remittent;
and these into continued fever.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">{84}</a></span></p>

<h3 class="header"><i>Remittent Fevers</i>:</h3> <p class="header">fevers with remissions
and exacerbations, or which have not a temporary
and total cessation, are the most universal
febrile form in all parts of the globe.
Throughout the equatorial oven, or middle
regions of the earth, from Cancer to Capricorn,
intermittents, but, above all, remittents
and dysenteries are the most universal type of
fever. They are the locusts which devour
whole crops of mankind. During the periodical
rainy seasons of the tropical zones;
particularly where they are choaked up with
woods and morasses, and in uncultivated new
settlements, these fevers often ravage with the
desolation of an Egyptian pestilence; and are
sometimes so precipitate as to kill in one or
two paroxisms, if not sooner repulsed; the
doctor, lawyer, and priest quickly succeeding
each other in their visits. They destroy not
only multitudes immediately, especially of
the new European settlers; but when improperly
treated, or when convalescents from
irregularity, fall back into relapses, they
often terminate in fatal chronic diseases,
similar to those recently enumerated under
the intermittent train.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">{85}</a></span></p>

<p>Not only within the tropicks, but likewise
through the northern hemisphere, to the verge
nearly of the polar circles, we can descry this
remittent febrile host. In the sultry summer
and autumnal seasons of Europe, in low
marshy countries, soils and situations such as
Italy and Hungary, where the summers are
long and intense; and in that northern morass,
Holland, these are the epidemical tyrants.
Armies encamped are often at that
season grievously infested with them, and with
dysenteric fluxes. In Britain and Ireland
also, they are frequent and fatal epidemicks;
and are not confined to the summer season
only. Even in most dry countries and situations
without the tropicks, after an unusual
close sultry summer, with long protracted
heats, we often see, or read of, such fevers and
fluxes. The humours then, says Pringle, are
corrupted, the solids relaxed; and in such a
disposition of body, irregularities in diet, wet
cloaths, and damp air, may give activity to
such latent indisposition. In that small
southern Mediterranean island, as described by
Cleghorn, where the soil is rocky, but the
summer heats excessive, such fevers have raged
with atrocious severity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">{86}</a></span></p>

<p>Fevers intermittent and remittent, and
those strictly simple inflammatory, are greatly
regulated, not only by the climate, latitude,
soil, local elevation or depression, but also in
the same country by the different seasons of
the year.  In summer and autumn, fevers
tend in various degrees to affect the stomach
and intestines with sickness; they are then,
more or less remittent, and participate less of
the inflammatory. “In Holland,” continues
Pringle, “towards June, a healthy month,
the inflammatory fevers begin to recede;
and the remittent, bilious, and putrid often
succeed throughout the summer and autumn,
until the return of winter, when the
inflammatory again recommence; the seasons
and diseases insensibly interchanging
and running into each other.” We may
also add, that in all warm climates there is a
copious and superabundant secretion of bile;
and that none of the animal fluids so soon
turn putrid.  They are more obnoxious to
remittent fevers who are constantly exercised
in labour and fatigue, and exposed to the external
air, than other ranks who are comfortably
accommodated, cloathed, and fed.
Pringle remarks, that the peasants of Holland<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">{87}</a></span>
were always greater sufferers by the summer,
autumnal, and remittent fevers, than those of
the more opulent class; and also, that during
summer and winter, in the field and in garrison,
the private soldiers were more sickly than
the officers, and liable to fevers.</p>

<p>Remittent fevers seem to consist of a repetition
of protracted diurnal paroxisms, or periodical
aggravated exacerbations, nearly similar
to the intermittent or primitive type; but
without the latter’s complete intermission.
Authors have described them under a variety
of apellations; but they may be all comprehended
as ramifications of one great trunk,
or integral genus: they appear in essence
the same disease, and are cured by similar remedies.
In the medical nomenclature, they
are denominated remittent, semitertian, hemitritea,
tritophyea, double and triple tertian,
putrid remittent, marsh, camp, ardent,
bilious fevers, gall sickness: tertian
fever obscured under a mist of one or more
dangerous and prominent symptoms; hence
named tertiana lethargica, vertiginosa, soporosa,
apoplectica, paralytica, cataleptica, epileptica,
convulsiva, phrenitica, hysterica, syncopalis,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">{88}</a></span>
asthmatica, arthritica, cardialgica,
singultuosa, rheumatica, pleuritica, dysenterica,
atrabilaria, cholerica, emetica, diaphoretica,
pituitosa, miliaris, scorbutica.</p>

<p>Exclusive of the symptoms common to
such fevers, and partly delineated under the
intermittent paroxism, remittent fevers are
variously diversified by a rotine and medley
of nervous, putrid, and inflammatory symptoms;
but infinitely more of the two former.
The climate, season of the year, remissions,
and the notorious epidemick or endemick
of that region or place, all contribute
to their unerring detection. Sometimes they
attack very suddenly and violently with delirium
and inflammatory simulation; but soon
afterwards, and at the interval of a few days,
remissions are evident. Sometimes their approach
is in appearance mild, but not less
alarming. In general there are great lassitude,
debility, anxiety, restlessness, severe
headach, frequently delirium, especially at
the exacerbations; disturbed sleep, and not
refreshing; sickness at the stomach, nausea,
bilious vomiting, or efforts to evacuate the
ventricular contents; fecal excretion bilious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">{89}</a></span>
with gripes; inextinguishable thirst;
tongue dry and parched; quick hot respiration;
skin sometimes dry. When bile is redundant,
the intestinal excretion is often putrid
and offensive, with bilious diarrhœa or dysentery,
in repetition and quantity profuse, exciting
tenesmus, and sometimes excoriation of
the anus; to these may be added pain in the
stomach and intestines, tension and elevation
of the belly. According to Lind, the tropical
remittents are the most virulent, yet are
not contagious, unless accompanied with dysentery,
or the sick crowded together; which,
if an irrefragable fact, distinguishes this fever
from the nervous and putrid: and besides, in
those febrile epidemicks and endemicks, from
marshy effluvia, the remissions are more perceptible
and synchronous than in these from
animal contagion. From the air, season, and
medical treatment, the remittent may be converted
into the intermittent or continued
type; in the intermittent there is more security.
In warm climates putrescency and
death may ensue in a few paroxisms; in
others, in all the intervals during three weeks:
and usually the crisis is by some of the larger
excretories.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">{90}</a></span></p>

<h3 class="header"><i>Nervous and Putrid Fevers.</i></h3> <p class="header">This febrile
host are also widely dispersed over the earth;
and probably are not so much governed or
influenced as the preceding remittents by the
climate, season, and sensible qualities of the
atmosphere; but may originate in all countries,
climates, seasons, and situations; and
when extremely virulent, may, like the plague
or small pox, be communicated by imperceptible
emanation or contagion from one infected
person to another; by personal intercourse,
by the medium of polluted goods,
furniture, apparel, cloaths, and houses; in all
which the noxious miasma may be concentrated
and lodged. Sometimes they harrass a
nation or city in detachment only; and sometimes
in formidable phalanx. Such fevers
are frequently engendered in jails, crowded
with filth and animal steams, and excluded
from free ventilation: also in military hospitals,
crammed with sick, with dysenteries,
putrid sores, and mortifications: also in ships
and large fleets, when hastened out in the
hurry and spur of approaching hostilities: also
in wet and stormy weather at sea, when the
hatches are closed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">{91}</a></span></p>

<p>In cities, contagious fevers may be traced
to prisons, perhaps sometimes to hospitals;
certainly often to narrow courts and alleys,
and small crowded apartments; to the
houses of the indigent; to filth, rags, and
squalid poverty, co-operating with foul unventilated
air: and in the open perflated
streets, are much less frequent. Cities, therefore,
should be more infested with them than
the country; and the poor more than the
affluent. Children with adults are subject to
them, but more of the latter. In London,
perhaps, nine-tenths of the fevers, are of the
remittent, nervous, and putrid type, and not
of the simple inflammatory. But I exclude
from this calculation the exanthematous order,
and the topical inflammations. Some,
not without argument, alledge, that slow
nervous fevers are in general derived from the
same origin; and that they differ from the
putrid in degree only. Petechial spots are by
no means constant symptoms of the putrid
type; but when they occur, they point out
the disease more unerringly, and its greater
malignity. In many instances, their differences
may be rationally imputed to climate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">{92}</a></span>
season, constitution, miasma, and medical
treatment.</p>

<p>I meet with inextricable embarrassment, in
endeavouring to draw the exact limits, not
only between nervous and putrid fevers, but
also between them and what some authors
have termed the universal remittent of this
island; and which is not limited to any season
of the year. I take this opportunity,
therefore, to avow, that in what proportion
these very general fevers with remissions originate
from marshy effluvia, from climate,
and constitutional indisposition, from animal
contagion, or from other occult causes, I am
unable to decide: Their precise relation as
to lineage and consanguinity, is beyond my
penetration. Nervous and putrid fevers have
been described under the following different
names: slow nervous fevers, febricula, maligna
lenta insidiose mitis, nervous and putrid
fevers, putrid remittents, typhus castrensis,
jail, hospital, infectious, putrid, malignant,
continued, putrid, spotted, purple, petechial
fevers; yellow fever of the West Indies, or
typhus Icterodes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">{93}</a></span></p>

<p>Slow nervous fever frequently steals on
with treacherous mildness; the sick are rendered
unfit for business, but yet not confined to
bed, and except to sagacious judges, the fever
is not apparently alarming; and too often the
sick and their friends are lulled into fatal security.
The symptoms slight alternate chills
and fugacious heats, especially in the evenings;
heaviness, giddiness, and headach, particularly
in the posterior and superior part, and
the pain often descending down the spine;
great debility and prostration of strength;
and in both nervous and putrid, the functions
of the brain, and of muscular motion, considerably
weakened, and interrupted; also
depression of spirits, sighing, restlessness, very
little sleep and not refreshing; accelerated,
weak, and small pulse; nausea, total inappetency;
inconsiderable heat of the skin or
thirst; dry tongue, a little yellow at the
sides; pale urine, and without sediment;
irregular sweats; sometimes pains resembling
rheumatick. After a few days, the fever,
stupor, delirium, and headach increase, with
low muttering delirium, chiefly during the
nocturnal exacerbation, and with noise in
the ears, and universal debility of the corporeal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">{94}</a></span>
and mental organs. The remissions
are generally more distinct in the beginning,
and, by degrees, more obscure.</p>

<p>Putrid fever sometimes creeps on with
deceitful approach under the nervous cloak;
and sometimes, with furious onset, counterfeits
the inflammatory. The symptoms
when radicated and inveterate are, unremitting
headach, pain in the back and
loins, and course of the spine; vertigo, throbbing
of the temporal and carotid arteries,
noise in the ears; delirium, extreme diminution
of strength and despondency of mind,
trembling of the hands and tongue when
thrust out; anxiety, restlessness, or no refreshing
sleep; intense burning heat of the
skin, especially in the evenings; nausea, bitter
taste in the mouth, vomiting of green or
black bile: sometimes insatiable thirst; at
other times the sick are insensible to thirst
and heat, and only complain of universal
languor and weariness; the tongue, teeth,
and lips covered with a brown or black tenacious
crust, with thrush and ulcers; the fecal
excretion black, and fetid; the breath
and perspiration offensive to the smell; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">{95}</a></span>
pulse progressively small, irregular, and
quick, often 130 to 140 pulsations, even in
adults, every minute; the eyes glazy, the
vessels of the tunica albugina turgid with
blood, and what is called blood-shot: in
stages of still more virulency, petechial
eruption sprinkled on the skin, with hemorrhages
from the gums and nose, and hemorrhagick
subcutaneous extravasations. In
the yellow fever of the West Indies, there is
a jaundice-colour of the eyes.</p>

<p>In the duration, crisis, and termination of
nervous and putrid fevers, there is considerable
diversity. Some may be suddenly
stifled before they burst into a flame: some
of inveterate malignity may prove fatal in
a few days; others may terminate in all
the intervals within three weeks, or even
later. Some terminate auspiciously without
any sensible crisis or evacuation: in
others, there is more or less sensible defecation
by some of the excretories, by perspiration
and sweat; diarrhœa and fetid
stools; turbid urine; exspuition and salivation;
vomiting; tumor of the parotid
glands; eruption about the mouth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">{96}</a></span></p>

<p>Miliary fever, febris purpurata, rubra
and alba, is never epidemick, and is denied
to be a primary disease; but is spurious,
symptomatick, accessary, or fortuitous; it is
very rare, and may be complicated with the
nervous and putrid, and with small pox and
measles. The miliaris alba is more frequent
amongst the female sex, especially during
the puerperal state, and in other females
debilitated by fluor albus, and hemorrhages,
of weak constitutions, delicate,
prolifick. It sometimes exhibits previous
symptoms of angina, pleurisy, catarrh, rheumatism,
erysipelas. Its peculiar diagnosticks
are extreme languor, anxiety, despondency,
terror, sighing, prostration of strength,
headach, delirium, restlessness, quick weak
pulse, oppression of the breast and stomach,
dry cough without expectoration; sometimes
profuse sweats towards the third day or later,
and the sooner the worse; inextinguishable
thirst; urine and stools various. In different
stages of the fever, after a few days,
a cutaneous efflorescence is perceivable, from
which the disease takes its name, preceded by
and accompanied with itching and pricking
heat of the skin, and eruption of diminutive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">{97}</a></span>
pustules, the size of millet seed, and, by the
fingers, may be felt prominent: they are
rarely seen on the face; commonly on the
neck, back, breast, and extremities; some of
them change into small serous vesications, distinct
or clustered, and emitting a peculiar sour
odour: of these there is often a retrocession
and new eruption, variously protracting the
fever to a few days, or even weeks. It is
distinguishable from measles by the pruriency
and sour smell, and the absence of morbillous
sternutation.</p>

<h3 class="header"><i>Inflammatory Fevers</i>,</h3> <p class="header">synochus continua
non putris of Boerhaave. To this we may
add the febris diaria. A different genus of
fever, both in its nature and cure, from the
remittent, nervous, and putrid, is the simple
inflammatory. The frequency and the fatality
of this fever, is infinitely inferior to
the preceding groups; and in comparison,
is as a wasp to a tyger; or a babe to Hercules.
The false lights hung out successively
by multitudes of authors, and transmitted,
in some degree, through the Boerhaavean
school, to steer with the antiphlogistick
compass and lancet in each hand, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">{98}</a></span>
the generality of fevers, have been the cause
of numerous shipwrecks. Inflammatory fever
is frequently complicated with some
local inflammation, and then is distinguished
under a different name, and hereafter described.
Pringle observes, that in military
camps, pleurisies, and peripneumonies are the
most frequent form of fever with inflammation;
and next to these acute rheumatisms.</p>

<p>The predominancy and reign of inflammatory
fever in northern latitudes, is in winter
and spring, in cold climates and rigorous
seasons, and where cold and moisture
are combined. It commonly attacks the
robust, strong, athletick, and those in the
vigour of life: it is not contagious; and
neither its remission nor exacerbation are
conspicuous. Its assault is sudden and violent,
with severe headach, quick laborious
respiration, interrupted sleep and restlessness,
or sometimes somnolency; sometimes delirium;
but in general the mental functions
are not greatly disordered, nor the
muscular debility so great as in the nervous
and putrid fevers: pulse accelerated, strong,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">{99}</a></span>
full, and tense; commotion and throbbing
of the temporal and carotid arteries; intense
heat of the skin, dryness of the mouth, fauces,
tongue, and nose; ingurgitation of drink
with avidity; the urine somewhat crimson
in tincture, and in small quantity; the belly
generally costive; the blood drawn, forming
a buffy incrustation on the contracted coagulum,
complete its portrait. The natural crisis
is various by nasal hemorrhage, by sweats,
turbid urine, diarrhœa; and the duration of
the fever from four to eleven days. The Febris
Diaria of a few days continuance, is a
sort of minor or infant species, an appendix
of the inflammatory: it begins suddenly
with nausea, vomiting, shivering,
cold, headach, lassitude, heat of the skin,
flushed face, restlessness, or disturbed sleep,
strong quick pulse: and is rarely dangerous.</p>

<p>With respect to all the preceding confederate
genera of fevers, we shall make the
following general observation. In the preceding
century, during the last thirty years,
febrile mortality, by the London bills, is
rated at 87,645: and the mortality of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">{100}</a></span>
present century is seen in the Chart. Formerly,
in this metropolis and island, and
probably throughout Europe, fevers seem
to have been much more prevalent and fatal
than at present: their essential nature
and cure is now much better understood by
physicians; and we are provided with far
more powerful auxiliary remedies, and are
more expert in their application.  In this
particular instance, modern medicine, especially
of the century in which we live, is
signalized, and may, without arrogance,
claim triumphal honours.  The supposed
innumerable varieties of fevers, and from
which perplexity Sydenham could not altogether
extricate himself, is now disproved
by repeated experience, and by the infallible
efficacy of general remedies. It is, however,
as yet impossible to fix any definite
medium or average of mortality in the
above genera of fevers, whether remittent,
nervous, putrid, or inflammatory.  We
have modern authentick records, wherein,
under judicious and skilful treatment, of 200
sick in remittent fevers only one died; and
even in the nervous and putrid, the blanks
were trifling compared to the prizes; whereas,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">{101}</a></span>
under different and erroneous management,
one half, and often the greatest part
of the sick perished. The corroboration of
these assertions may be seen in those learned
authors, Lind, Millar, Robinson, Clarke,
Lettsom, Sims, and others.</p>

<p>Throughout the intire morbid host of
human foes, there is probably no such flagrant
variation in the therapeutick barometer,
or scale of mortality, as in that of the
fevers hitherto described. Different curatory
processes and remedies soon change the
natural genus, symptoms, crisis, prognosticks,
and event. No dangerous diseases almost
whatsoever, are more successfully oppugnable
under discreet medical regimen;
and when entrusted to nature, from the days
of Hippocrates to the present time, they have
ever been extremely fatal. Sorry I am to
add, that, perhaps in many instances, the
errors and fatality of nature, have been less
destructive than those of artificial and therapeutick
mismanagement. Since the discovery
of antimonials and Peruvian bark,
few now, under skilful medical pilots, die,
compared to the multitudes of sick: but still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">{102}</a></span>
in the aggregate list of funerals, except perhaps
pulmonary Consumptions, it may be
doubted whether any other of the belligerent
morbid foes commit such ravages amongst
mankind.</p>

<h3 class="header"><i>Small Pox</i>,</h3> <p class="header">natural and inoculated. We
have no vestiges, neither in history nor tradition,
of this loathsome disease, nor of the
measles, before the irruption of Mahomet
and his followers from the Arabian deserts,
about 1,300 years ago; and from whom
this extraneous contagion was first transplanted
into Europe. It is little more than
200 years since the exportation of this exotic
poison to the American continent, where
it had never before been seen nor heard of.
The havock by this scourge of the human
race, amounts, in London, to nearly a decimation
of the inhabitants; or to about one
tenth, or one twelfth. It is equally or oftener
much more fatal throughout the torrid
and frigid zones; and in the adult age is
more violent than in childhood.  It attacks
the same person but once in life: had this
not been the case, the human race must
long since have been extinct. On a promiscuous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">{103}</a></span>
average, one of every seven infected
die of the natural disease; but under inoculation
only 1 of 500. Besides, to the
former deadly catalogue may be superadded
a frightful train of mangled constitutions
and countenances, of consumptions, abscesses,
ulcers, opthalmias, blindness.</p>

<p>In every large metropolis, small pox is
an annual epidemick. In country towns
and open districts, its invasions are more
distant; at uncertain intervals of some
years, when numbers contiguous are attacked
at the same time. In our climate,
it is alledged to be most prevalent in spring
and autumn. Very few of the human species
escape the small pox, especially in populous
cities and towns, wherein there is always
lasting variolous fuel, or, lurking embers:
a wooden horse with ferocious foes
in ambuscade, tolerated within their walls,
rioting in human slaughter, and infantile
immolation. It might easily be demonstrated,
that in London, and probably in all
other large cities, variolous ravages are principally
amongst children under five years of
age. Without entering into any elaborate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">{104}</a></span>
argumentation, or proofs of this assertion,
the reader may, in some degree, be convinced,
by only turning his eye to the first Chart,
and to a small table of London mortality
during ten years; wherein he will observe
the trifling annual mortality in the interval
between 5 and 20 years; before
which last period, a mere handful of the
native progeny of the metropolis can be
supposed to have escaped an infection with
which they are constantly enveloped. It is
obvious that the total annual mortality by
all diseases, inclusively, in London during
this adolescent period of life of 15 years,
is not equal to variolous carnage singly. As
to inoculation, or artificial engrafting of the
contagion, it is throughout the greatest part
of Europe a modern practice of the present
century, and is yet in its cradle. Even in
the London small pox hospital, since its first
institution, forty years ago, there have not
been inoculated altogether 25,000.</p>

<p>The cruel carnage perpetrated by small
pox throughout the earth; the rooted prejudices,
and the insinuations urged to shackle
the universal benefits of inoculation, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">{105}</a></span>
which pervade not only the ignorant mass of
the community, but also the generality of the
medical profession throughout Europe, would
abundantly excuse and urge me to be more
diffuse on this interesting and litigated topick.
But having, some years ago, published
a small Essay on Inoculation, and
having now nearly finished a general treatise
on the natural and inoculated small pox,
I shall postpone the result of much reading
and reflection to that republication. An
acquiescence in neutrality or indifference,
where it can be proved to mathematical demonstration
that myriads of lives might be
preserved, which are now sacrificed, would,
at least in a moral sense, constitute an accessary
in criminality.</p>

<p>Small pox, or variolæ, have been properly
discriminated into several species: the distinct
and confluent, or benign and malign;
the crystalline, lymphatick, warty, petechial,
and hemorrhagick; the inoculated; the spurious.
The principal differences between
small pox consist in the period of eruption,
the number and form of the pustules, the
quantity and state of the fluid contained in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">{106}</a></span>
them, and the contumacious perseverance
of the fever. The progress of variolous
fever has been divided into four stages, that
preceding the eruption; the eruption; the
suppuration; and the exsiccation of the pustules.
The first visible effects of the contagion
and fever are nausea, vomiting, soreness
at the stomach, drowsiness: before the eruption
infants are prone to startings, and
some even to epileptic fits; adults to sweats.
The second stage of eruption is, from three
to four days, from the first attack, of small
red spots or pimples on the skin, resembling
flea-bites, in number and quantity extremely
various; from one or more, multiplied to
many hundreds. The eruption is commonly
first on the face, spreading gradually over
the body and extremities, and is compleated
about the fifth or sixth day from the febrile
commencement: and on this eruption, the
fever abates or subsides. In the third stage
of maturation the pimples increase daily in
size; are elevated into prominences inflamed
at the base; and the suppuration is compleated
between the eighth and eleventh
day from the first attack: the pustules then
detached from each other, have risen into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">{107}</a></span>
small boils, the size of peas or larger, turgid
with pus, gradually becoming opake, yellowish,
and tenacious. In the fourth stage
the pustules shrivel or burst, oozing out part
of their contents, and a superficial incrustation
is formed, which, after some days, together
with the shrivelled pustules, scales off,
leaving the subjacent skin of a brown red
colour. This is the mild form of the disease;
but we are next to describe it under
more dangerous and fatal forms.</p>

<p>In the Confluent small pox, the revolutions
are the same, but the symptoms more
exasperated; the vomiting and the eruptive
fever violent, frequently with coma, or
delirium. The eruption protrudes earlier;
on the second or third day, in congregated
clusters, like measles, and more numerous on
the face; the fever does not then subside,
but increases towards the fifth or sixth day,
and continues throughout the disease. The
swelling of the face is commonly earlier and
more severe: and both in confluent and distinct,
when the pustules are numerous on
the face and fauces, there is soreness and inflammation
of the throat, hoarseness, and
difficulty of swallowing; and about the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">{108}</a></span>
eighth day, the eye-lids are closed up with
temporary blindness. On the face, especially,
the pustules are small, less elevated, coalescent;
and it is often covered with a universal
flat vesicle: the fluid is whitish or
brownish, not yellow and tenacious, or of due
maturation and concocted purulency. The
pustular interstices, if any, are pale and flaccid.
The facial intumescence subsides about the
tenth or eleventh day: and during these stages
of fermentation and depuration, a salivation
commonly ensues, especially in adults; and
in infants a diarrhœa. About the fourth
stage the fever, called secondary, is often renewed
with considerable vehemence, and with
various duration and event. In the latter
stages the pustules excite intolerable itching
of the skin, and, if not prevented, incessant
scratching and cutaneous denudation: the
breath, exhalations and excretions are then offensive
to the smell. In the mild distinct, the
pustules commonly begin to dry on the ninth
day, and continue to the fourteenth in a process
of exsiccation; but in the confluent, this
stage begins about the eleventh day.</p>

<p>The following are all unfavourable omens
in small pox: Sudden and premature eruption<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">{109}</a></span>
of pustules. In this first stage, infants,
especially before dentition, are sometimes
snatched off in epileptick fits. The more
small pox appear in the confluent, or in the
distinct form, they are more or less perilous.
It is only where the distinct are
crowded with pustules on the face; or accompanied
with fever and putrescency; or
with pustules warty and lymphatick, that
they are dangerous. Or, a natural mild small
pox may be rendered malignant from confined
air, heated room, and regimen. In the
catalogue of unfavourable symptoms, are the
fever continuing pertinaceous; and with putrescency
it is still more dangerous: the pustules
not sufficiently filled and distended,
hard, or warty, or not filled with maturated
pus; the top of the pustules depressed; pale
interstices at their base; sudden retrocession
or subsidence of the pustules during the stage
of maturation: severe inflammation of the
fauces; difficult deglutition; severe pain at
the stomach. The secondary fever arising
commonly about the recession and exsiccation
of the pustules, or ebb of maturation, is
the most dangerous period of small pox. The
variolous crisis then is generally by diarrhœa,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">{110}</a></span>
or turbid urine, or both conjointly, or by salivation.
It is evident that, as the cutaneous
pores are blocked up, the absorbed, and other
floating pus, must be defecated by some
grosser excretory.  Additional symptoms of
alarm, especially in the confluent, are, if the
suppurating stage of the fever continues severe,
the salivation ceases, and the hands do
not then swell.  When the putrescency is
virulent, the disease sometimes proves fatal
in a few days; but in most cases on the
eleventh, and sometimes not until the fourteenth
or seventeenth.  Fatal symptoms of
putrescency are petechiæ, and bloody pustules;
putrid urine and stools; tumid emphysematous
abdomen.</p>

<p>Inoculated Small Pox. Between seven and
nine days, some slight fever succeeded by an
eruption of pustules; in general not numerous,
and the patients are very seldom confined
to bed, or indisposed. In ninety-nine
cases out of an hundred, inoculation produces
a distinct small pox, void of danger.
After inoculation from the maturated pustules
of real small pox, and the usual symptoms of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">{111}</a></span>
impregnation, mankind are ever after invulnerable
by this contagion.</p>

<p>Chicken Pox. Bastard or spurious; and
distinguished under the apellation of petite
verole volante, stein pox, and swain pox.
They are sometimes epidemick, but inoffensive;
and have given rise to the supposition
of a person’s undergoing the natural
small pox a second time. The eruption
forms very quickly into pustules, of which
the pus is not concocted, nor tenacious; and
after three or four days, incrustations.</p>

<h3 class="header"><i>Measles.</i></h3> <p class="header">
Morbilli rubeola. From 100
to 120th part of the community seem to
be destroyed by measles. Morbillous mortality
is to that of small pox in the ratio of
one to ten or twelve; and consequently
may be estimated at one of seventy-seven
whom it attacks. Sydenham, long ago observed,
that measles, if judiciously treated,
are attended with very little danger; but he
should at least have qualified the expression,
by adding immediate and considerable danger;
for both immediately, and in their future
consequences, they are by no means so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">{112}</a></span>
innocuous. Few escape this exotick contagion,
especially in childhood and in cities.
It attacks the same persons but once in life;
and, with us, is said to be most epidemick in
winter.</p>

<p>Morbillous symptoms are fever, impaired
appetite, heaviness of the head and eyes,
somnolency, catarrh, acrid defluxion from
the fauces, nose, and eyes, with hoarseness,
sneezing, and lachrymation; short dry cough,
and some difficulty in respiration. Prior to
the eruption, there is generally anxiety about
the breast, palpitation of the heart, itching
of the face, peevishness, and considerable fever.
On the third or fourth day there is
an eruption of small red spots first on the
face, resembling the bites of ants or fleas,
generally confluent and entangled, and broad
on the trunk and extremities; but not elevated
above the skin, nor rising into pustules,
nor suppurating: the size and shape various
and irregular. About the sixth day
the eruption on the face begins to dry, and
on the ninth, is totally obliterated with desquamation
of the cuticle. With the eruption
the fever frequently does not cease;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">{113}</a></span>
and the cough and difficulty in respiration
often continue beyond the eruptive limits
and cuticular desquamation. The usual
crisis is by scaling of the cuticle, turbid
urine, or diarrhœa. Unfavourable symptoms
are, too sudden or too tardy eruption;
pale or yellow eruption; great debility;
and above all, pulmonick inflammation. The
last in the train of morbillous evils and
consequences are, consumption, anasarca,
ophthalmy. Sometimes, though rarely, measles
have been seen in accompanyment with
other eruptive fevers, as small pox, and gangrenous
angina.</p>

<h3 class="header"><i>Scarlet fever.</i></h3> <p class="header">Febris scarlatina, ignis
facer, scarlatina anginosa. Its mortality in
the London bills is added to the general febrile
heap. This contagious epidemick is
most frequent in the infant and adolescent
age; it attacks families and schools about
one time; and the same person but once
in life; and is said to be most frequent in
winter. It is generally accompanied with
an anginous or ulcerous sore throat, but not
putrid. That genus or species of scarlet fever
which usually accompanies angina gangrenosa,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">{114}</a></span>
and is extremely dangerous, is hereafter
described. The symptoms of simple scarlet
are the usual febrile precursors; on the
second, third, or fourth day, an eruption of
broad irregular redness and spots; general
or partial only over the face, trunk, and
extremities, and not elevated above the surface:
sometimes overspreading the face with
a crimson colour. Concomitant symptoms
are, difficulty of swallowing, and uneasiness
in the throat, redness, tension, and sloughs:
commonly also nausea, sickness at the stomach,
vomiting, vertigo, drowsiness, headach,
difficulty of breathing, anxiety. After
three or four days more; that is, between
the sixth and ninth, the cutaneous eruption
and redness disappears, with desquamation
of the cuticle, and harrassing pruriency.
The usual crisis is by sweats, urine, fetid
stools, and exscreation of sloughs.  Sometimes,
a few days after the cuticular desquamation,
an anasarcous swelling suddenly
appears; and during the convalescent state,
from exposure to cold air, or neglect of cutaneous
and other expurgation, anasarca, hydrothorax
or ascites have ensued.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">{115}</a></span></p>

<p>There are two or three other febrile eruptions
to which authors have appropriated
distinct names, but by which very few of the
human race are destroyed. These are febris
urticata, bullosa, and pemphigodes.
In general, they consist of red spots and serous
vesicles on different parts of the skin,
exciting heat and itching; the urticata resembling
blisters from the burning of nettles.
Some of these are mobile, receding
and re-appearing, and prone to relapse. After
a few days, however, or at the utmost
a few weeks, they vanish: and are not contagious
nor epidemick.</p>

<h3 class="header"><i>Plague.</i></h3> <p class="header">Pestis. This febrile demon
cannot now be called one of the mortal epidemicks
of Europe, except in the south-east
extremity, inhabited by the Turks. The
two greatest pestilences on record, happened
in the sixth and fourteenth centuries of our
era; which, with more barbarous havock
than that of Goths or Saracens, overwhelmed
millions in three quarters of the globe in
one indiscriminate massacre. In London,
before the general conflagration in 1666,
of one half nearly of the old city, the plague<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">{116}</a></span>
was very frequent: but since that event,
or at the most two or three years after,
it has been exterminated and banished from
us. That fortunate disaster which consumed
a magazine of putrefaction; together
with widened streets, ventilation, cleanliness,
and many other causes, have all contributed
to the extinction of this exotick incendiary.
For it is well known, that pestilential
miasma has been preserved dormant
many years in porous materials. From
1592 to 1665, the plague appears to have
had annually more or less share in the mortality
of the British metropolis; and adding
together the different periods of its duration,
amounts to twenty-five years. In
1665, which is the most furious pestilence
in the London annals, the deaths amounted
to 100,000; but in the eight preceding
years, to only 113. Registers, in other parts
of Europe, prove, that this disease has committed
direful carnage since our emancipation.
At Marseilles they can enumerate
twenty general plagues, which have successively
laid waste that populous city. Many
other European cities and towns, during
the last and present century, and especially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">{117}</a></span>
those bordering on the Mediterranean,
have, in a very short space of time, severely
smarted by pestilence, and have been nearly
depopulated.</p>

<p>At present, in all the Mediterranean ports
they are, from fatal experience, scrupulously
vigilant to guard, by a circumvallation of
alarm posts, against the pestilential infection,
and the clandestine entry of infected goods
or merchandize. It rarely now gains admittance,
by stealth into any of the European
ports; (Constantinople excepted) or
even if imported to our shores, the wise precautions
and regulations, enacted by Quarantines,
soon check its irruption and progress.
This is a most interesting epoch
and improvement in the police of modern
states; for the original institution and rough
draft of which, about 300 years ago, we
are indebted to the Venetians. The political
ordinances, however, enacted for the
exclusion and suppression of pestilential contagion,
were, until the present century, extremely
erroneous and impolitick. Formerly,
the plague in London, and in most other European
cities, where it was permitted to sojourn,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">{118}</a></span>
was rendered infinitely more terrifick
and destructive by injudicious legislative regulations;
especially by the barbarous sacrifice,
and absurd policy of sick and sound
immured together, with a forlorn motto
on their doors, until all were dead or recovered.
This was an effectual discouragement
against an early alarm which, as in
cases of fire, is of the utmost importance.
It is evident, by the London bills, that a
mere handful, at any time, died in the publick
pest-house; consequently, every corner
of the city was polluted with infection.</p>

<p>True plague is now chiefly chained down
to Constantinople, and to Grand Cairo in
Egypt, the two original, or at least one of the
hotbeds and volcanos of pestilence; to several
of the maritime towns of Asia and Africa
situated on the Archipelago and Mediterranean;
as Smyrna, Aleppo, Tripoli, Tunis,
Algiers, &amp;c. In many of these cities the pestilential
miasma is hatched and accumulated
into venomous malignity: it is in some nearly
an annual, or triennial epidemick. At this
day, plague almost solely wreaks its venom
on the Mahometan nations, whose prejudices<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">{119}</a></span>
and ignorance, rivetted by religious and
predestinarian absurdities, give licence and
activity to its imperious domination. From
such implicit and enthusiastick submission
to the tenets of the Alcoran, joined to
gross stupidity in science and philosophy,
the Mahometans are encouraged, defenceless
and rash, to brave this most malignant and
terrible of the febrile host.</p>

<p>Fortunately for mankind, the pestilential
contagion spreads to a very small distance
through the air, without some contact or
adhesion to infected goods and porous materials;
or by personal communication and intercourse
of the sound with the diseased.
The atmosphere is not tainted to any considerable
distance. A neighbour barricading
himself within his house, at a few yards
distance from infection, may escape unhurt.
If pestilential contagion could be so suddenly
and widely scattered over a kingdom as
epidemical influenza, the earth, in a few
months, would be converted into an enormous
church-yard. It is not like some other
exotick poisons of the exanthematous order,
after enduring which once, mankind are rendered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">{120}</a></span>
invulnerable: the plague, as well as
putrid fever, may attack the same person
repeatedly. What proportion die or recover,
I cannot ascertain; and indeed the prophylactic
or preventitive, is infinitely the most
important indication. Its invariable characteristic
features are buboes, carbuncles,
and petechiæ. The general progress of the
symptoms are, great abasement of strength
and of spirits, apprehension of death, dejected
countenance, and wildness of the eyes;
nausea, vomiting of bile; headach, giddiness,
delirium; weak irregular pulse; petechiæ,
hæmorrhages; fetid breath and excretions;
buboes or boils in the inguinal, axillary, or
jugular lymphatick glands; and appearing
early, or in the progress of the disease; besides
gangrenous carbuncles in different parts.
According to the virulence of the contagion,
and other co-operating causes, the disease
may be fatal in a few hours, a few days, or
in one, two, or three weeks. The poison
arrested in the lymphatic glands and suppurating,
is a favourable presage. Domestick
animals, as quadrupeds and fowls, are liable
to the infection, and to be changed into
carrion.</p>

<h3 class="header"><i>Sweating Sickness</i>,</h3> <p class="header">ephemera sudatoria et
elodes, cannot now be considered as an
epidemick cause of mortality. Somewhat
more than 300 years ago, this singular contagious
and vagrant disease burst out, for the
first time, in the army of Henry VII. in his
return to England from an expedition against
France; and in four hours sickness, numbers
were exterminated: but by keeping warm
in bed, under profuse sweats, the dangerous
whirlpool generally was escaped. The same
infection was imported into England at
several subsequent intervals; but happily,
its greatest devastation was always of short
duration; and this morbid meteor has long
since disappeared from our island, and from
Europe. Its symptoms were continued profuse
sweats, extreme debility, fainting, anxiety,
restlessness, pain in the stomach, thirst,
vertigo, quick irregular pulse. Sometimes
it was fatal in one day; and, if the sick survived
to the seventh, they generally recovered.</p>

<h3 class="header">Of the predisposing and occasional <i>Causes</i>
of fevers,</h3> <p class="header">intermittent and remittent, nervous
and putrid, inflammatory, small-pox, measles,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">{122}</a></span>
scarlet, plague, sweating sickness. The
principal causes of the preceding genera of
fevers may conveniently be presented at one
view, in abbreviation. We throw to one
side all that specious romance and sapient
pomposity, strutting in the tinsel robes of
proximate causes, and merely attend to the
predisponent and occasional. Because, after
diving and climbing as assiduously as many
of our fellow-labourers in search of those
arcana, we experienced reiterated retrogradation;
and, as in metaphysicks, error supplanted
by error. Neither do we attempt
to pry into those latent predispositions in
the human organization, which renders them
susceptible to many various febrile impressions.</p>

<p>The predisposing and occasional causes of
intermittent and remittent fevers are, cloudy
winter and autumn: northern morasses:
noxious miasma or emanation from morasses,
from countries and soils low, damp, woody,
uncultivated, especially in warm climates,
weather, and seasons: atmosphere moist
and hot: foggy atmosphere: unusual irregularity
of the seasons and atmosphere:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">{123}</a></span>
unusual continuance of cold rainy weather:
damp night-air, especially in warm unhealthy
climates: excessive heats: burning
zones and regions: sudden vicissitudes from
heat to cold of the seasons and weather:
unusually excessive and long continued heats:
also damp weather, particularly when unusually
warm for the season and climate:
damp ground-floors and habitations: damp
sheets and beds: sleeping in the open air,
and on damp ground: sudden stoppage of
perspiration: bile depraved, redundant;
septick miasma introduced from without,
or generated within the body: efforts of
nature to disencumber its functions and organs
of some clogs or impurities. Perhaps
rather contributing as exciting causes are
passions of mind, fatigue, hardships, long
watching, hunger, thirst, intoxication, venery,
interruption of the excretions, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The predisposing and occasional causes of
nervous and putrid fevers are, many or perhaps
all of the preceding causes: noxious
miasma or contagion, engendered from human
effluvia in cities, jails, hospitals, dirty,
small, crowded houses and apartments,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">{124}</a></span>
especially in unventilated alleys and lanes;
accumulation of corporeal filth from want
of cloathing, change of raiment, slothfulness;
contagion concentrated in porous materials,
furniture, raiment, and houses: cadaverous
exhalations, effluvia from putrid carcasses of
animals, and from both animal and vegetable
heaps in a state of fermentative putrefaction:
damp rainy seasons: bad harvest, and putrid
grain; putrid diet animal or farinaceous: improper
medical treatment of remittent fevers;
corrupted bile, or other secerned and excreted
fluids, noxious in quantity or quality: profuse
evacuation, immoderate venery, desponding
passions of mind, intemperance in food or
drink, stoppage of perspiration, &amp;c. Of miliary
fever the causes are, estuation, hot regimen,
and rooms, during fever or parturition, excessive
evacuations, weak constitutions, debility,
depressing passions, moist air, wet summer.</p>

<p>The predisposing and occasional causes of
inflammatory fevers and diary are, cold climate
and winter: cold winds: change of
seasons: heat of the atmosphere: insolation:
excessive labour, exercise, and fatigue: violent
passions of mind: long watching:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">{125}</a></span>
cold drink when the body is heated: intoxication
with spirituous liquors: crude chyle:
heating stimulating diet: disordered stomach,
plethora: excess of coagulable lymph and its
tenacity: menstrual, lacteal, hæmorrhoidal,
arthritick: warm baths; excruciating pain.</p>

<p>The predisposing and occasional causes of
small pox, measles, scarlet fever, and sweating
sickness, are unknown, both as to their source
and nature: the two first are exotick leavens.
Of plague: venomous effluvia in certain hot
climates, from putrid animal exhalations and
filth, such as the stagnant canals and reservoirs
of putridity in the city of Grand Cairo:
putrid emanations from swarms of dead locusts.
Predisposing causes to pestilential infection
are, long watching, hunger, poor diet,
intemperance, excess of venery, fatigue, terror,
fear, debility, low spirits, &amp;c.</p>

<p>With respect to the great sources of fevers,
noxious miasma from morasses, contagion
from human effluvia, and animal
bodies, and that from specifick unknown
origin, I shall make a few observations. Of
what elementary nature miasma and contagion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">{126}</a></span>
consist; the analysis of their minute
atoms; whether animalculæ, or to us invisible
emanations, I pretend not to decide.
Of small pox, measles, scarlet fever, and
sweating sickness, we are totally ignorant of
their origin and essence.  We, however,
know to a certainty, and it is of infinitely
more importance to the publick safety, that
neither marshy miasma, nor those from
human effluvia, spread to any considerable
distance through the air.  Even by the
plague the atmosphere is tainted to a very
inconsiderable distance; and mankind find an
asylum and sanctuary within a few yards.
Nor do marshy miasma emitted from the
earth, mount or diffuse themselves to any
considerable distance in the air: the inhabitants
at the top of a hill have continued
healthy, whilst those situated in a swamp at
the bottom, have been infested with intermittents,
and remittents. To what distance
the contagion of small pox, measles, and
scarlet fever extend through the air, I am
ignorant: like the plague, the two former
have been transplanted to distant regions,
in animal bodies, or in polluted porous
materials.  Another important discovery of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">{127}</a></span>
modern times is, that by fire and smoke, the
heat of a baker’s oven, the most virulent
contagion may be annihilated, when concentrated
in apparel, spungy materials, ships,
houses, &amp;c.</p>

<h3 class="header"><i>Of Febrile Prognosticks.</i></h3> <p class="header">The event of all
the preceding fevers (intermittent excepted)
is terminated with precipitancy in a few
days, or, at the utmost, a few weeks in recovery,
in death, or in some other disease.
The predictions in fevers, and indeed in all
diseases, should be deduced from the comparative
mortality at different ages; the
comparative mortality by different fevers;
the symptoms peculiar to each genus, whether
ominous or propitious; and the general
symptoms applicable to an intire group
or class. These enrich medicine with a rudder,
compass and quadrant: in them consist
the tactick and the sublime of medical
divination. We have already treated of
the three former, and have now only to
add the general febrile predictions.</p>

<p>It is foreign to my plan, to squander time
or words, in eulogy or censure of those elaborate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">{128}</a></span>
treatises on the pulse and urine, and
their presumed extensive application to the
diagnostick and prognostick of diseases. Of
strength and weakness, hardness and softness,
fulness and inanition, slowness, celerity,
velocity, saliency, intermission, irregularity,
and a few other distinctions of the
circulation and arterial pulsation, we are
competent judges; and of the measurement
of velocity to a still greater nicety with the
stop-watch. But, with all due reverence to
Galen and his copyists, down to De Bordeu,
in discriminating the multitude and variety,
if I may be permitted the expression, of
complicated tones, combinations, divisions,
subdivisions, chromaticks and chords in the
arterial vibrations, we confess the bluntness
and incapacity of our tangible organs. We
have still fewer scruples to disclaim that affected
sagacity and alchymistical intuition,
of forming auguries from the urine; from
its innumerable shades, intermixtures, pellicles,
precipitation, and sediment. This is,
even in our time, one of the decoys in vaticination
to inveigle the ignorant and credulous;
the stale manœuvres and chiromancy
of vagabond empiricism and imposture.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">{129}</a></span></p>

<p>A few words will finish our general remarks
on the pulse. From physiology, we
know that the whole mass of blood is circulated
round the body from the heart, its
lever and center, to the circumference, and
back again, in the space of a few minutes.
But in the velocity of the crimson torrent
and arterial pulsation, prodigious variations
ensue from age, sex, constitution, peculiar
temperament, climate, season, food, drink,
mental passions, exercise, rest, sleep, waking,
health, different diseases, and different
periods of the day. It is therefore, singly,
a precarious sign; and did time permit, there
would be no difficulty in demonstrating the
urine to be infinitely more fallible. From
infancy to old age, the velocity of the blood
decreases, and is one half slower: in the
adult and middle age, between sixty and
eighty pulsations every minute is the usual
natural pace: the febrile pulse is marked
at 96, and is sometimes spurred to 130 or
140; and in infants sometimes outstrips the
divisions of time or accurate mensuration.</p>

<p>All fevers with dangerous symptoms may
be termed malignant; but in general, this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">{130}</a></span>
term is appropriated to fevers, intermittent,
remittent, nervous, putrid, exanthematous,
and also to some of those complicated with
topical inflammation. General prognosticks
of danger are indicated by a concatenation
of few or many of the following symptoms,
which may, in some degree, be transposed
to the intire febrile class; and to
the phlogistick order not yet surveyed:
as the brain, lungs, abdominal viscera, and
organs indispensible to life, much deranged:
debility in the executive and legislative functions;
or vital, natural, and animal: signs of
putrefactions.</p>

<p>We shall enumerate the principal of those
in detail. The pulse weak, quick, fluttering,
salient, irregular, intermittent, its systole
duplicated, its velocity 130 or 140; tendency
to faint or fainting in an erect posture;
cold extremities: the respiration slow,
laborious, quick, cold; all the subsidiary
muscles of respiration labouring to distend
the thorax; deep interrupted sighs, hiccup;
particular noise in respiration, as if mucus
plugged up the throat and lungs: the stomach
very weak, with nausea, sickness, vomiting,
desire of acids; deglutition difficult,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">{131}</a></span>
struggling, and with noise; involuntary excretion
of feces and urine; thirst; the
tongue, teeth, and lips foul, and furred with
a black gelatinous incrustation; the urine
pale, red, black, fetid; intense burning heat
in the abdomen; the belly tumid and puffed;
fetid cadaverous smell and exhalations;
clammy sweats, especially in the breast:
the blood if drawn not coagulating: cutaneous
petechiæ, like small bruises in different
parts; subcutaneous effusions; hemorrhages:
weakness, confusion, irregularity in the intellectual
functions; the manners different
from natural; in the speech or actions something
unusual; loquacity; no sleep; coma
or delirium furious, or low and muttering;
in the countenance and eyes perturbation,
agitation, amazement, despondency,
despair, anxiety; attempts to rise out of
bed; throwing off the bed-cloaths, incessant
tossing about the bed; forgetfulness, loss of
memory, so as not to know the nearest
friend; refusing or exspuating food, drink, or
medicines; moats floating before the eyes,
and objects seen as through a cloud; total
inattention to every object; twitching and
spasms of the tendons at the wrist: catch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">{132}</a></span>ing
and picking with the hands and fingers
at the bed-cloaths, as if feeling for some object;
starting of the muscles, convulsions;
trembling of the hands and tongue when
thrust out; supine posture; inability to support
themselves erect or sitting; sliding
down to the foot of the bed: livid nose;
collapsed cheeks and temples; sunk and
glazy eyes; dead, ghastly countenance, cold
extremities.</p>

<p>It has been asserted by authors, that no
certain febrile presages can be formed before
the periodical crisis; but this is antiquated
and erroneous. In tropical climates,
the critical days are much more certain and
evident than in northern regions: and as
transmitted from the prognostical Alcoran
of Hippocrates, are the 3d or 4th, 5, 7, 9,
11, 14, 17, 20; which amounts to rather
more than one half critical, and the remainder
non-critical. On such critical days the
event is generally most decisive, whether
salutary or fatal; in the non-critical it
is a temporary respite. Besides, in tropical
climates, the moon is observed to have considerable
influence on febrile paroxisms, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">{133}</a></span>
crisis. As to the effect of febrile crisis on
the human excretories, we have been sufficiently
explicit. The favourable termination
of fevers is chiefly discovered by cessation
of delirium, abatement of the frequency of
the pulse; mild sweats equally diffused; the
urine depositing a sediment freely and copiously;
coolness of the skin; return of natural
sleep and appetite; and food recruiting
the lost strength. The storm is then subsided,
and the ship arrived at anchor.</p>

<p class="header">are now to be reviewed. The
majority of these in their immediate causes
and mode of cure, intimately anastomose;
and the principal differences in the symptoms
are to be ascribed to the different organs
and parts enraged by inflammation.
These are not like the generality of the preceding
fevers, in which most of the corporeal
functions participate: here, in many
cases, one single portion of the human organization
is originally transfixed with pain
and commotion; and doomed to bear the
brunt of the hydraulick torrent and inundation.
After mature consideration, we imagined
it would occasion less confusion and
burthen to the memory, to detach a few
diseases from the phlogistick legion. Inflammation
of the ears, eyes, intestines, kidneys,
and bladder, are incorporated amongst
the other diseases by which those various organs
are liable to be invested. I am aware
that this does not quadrate with the stiff
etiquette of nosological parade: but, without
digressing into a critical disquisition on
this subject, I shall content myself with simply
acknowledging that I am no convert to
any of those modern pedagogues in morbid
arrangement and nomenclature. With similar
and intentional omission, I avoid the technical
subtilities of parenchymatous and membranaceous
inflammation.</p>

<div class="force_p"><h3 class="header"><i>Inflammation of the Brain.</i></h3> <p class="header">Phrenitis vera.
As a primary disease, it is very rare in this
kingdom. It is much more frequent in
tropical and hot climates: and is the febrile
calenture of those scorching regions. With
us it is mostly symptomatick in different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">{135}</a></span>
fevers: and may either affect the brain and
medullary substance, or its investing membranes:
and in the former case the delirium
is said to be mild.  Morbid dissections have
proved, that when inflammation was believed
to be present, none could be discovered;
and in other cases, that the brain
was inflamed, without expressing the usual
symptoms.  Of idiopathick phrenzy, the
symptoms are, fever, excruciating and deep
seated headach, restlessness, and want of sleep;
intolerance of light and noise, with acute sensibility
and irritability; red, prominent, ferocious
eyes; audacious, and flushed countenance;
contracted and languid pulse; throbbing
of the temporal arteries; noise in the
ears; change in the voice; impetuous delirium,
and the patient, with difficulty, restrained
in bed; dry parched tongue, but
sometimes no complaint of thirst; costiveness;
limpid urine. It is extremely dangerous
and precipitate, terminating in a few
days in recovery, death, or some other disease;
and is rarely protracted beyond a week.
The favourable crisis is various: by nasal hemorrhage,
sweats, diarrhœa, turbid urine:
but on any irregularity or intemperance, convalescents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">{136}</a></span>
are prone to relapse. The predisposing
and occasional <i>causes</i> are, warm climate;
insolation, especially with the head
uncovered; sudden suppression of the puerperal
lochia; intoxication; violent passions
of mind; ambition, anger, grief, profound
contemplation, unremitting study; long deprivation
of sleep; external injuries; erysipelas,
or scald head prematurely repelled;
violent exercise; symptomatick.</p></div>

<h3 class="header"><i>Angina</i>:</h3> <p class="header">cynanche, quinsey; and distinguished
into the inflammatory; and into
the putrid, gangrenous, or malignant. The
mortality by quinsey and sore throat, appears
in the London bills inconsiderable;
and without discrimination of the inflammatory
and putrid. Inflammatory angina
is a general and frequent affliction in both
sexes, and especially in ours and some northern
regions. Adults more than infants; and
some individuals more than others, are obnoxious
to it: its reign is in spring and
autumn, on the change and vicissitudes of
the seasons, or of heat and cold. In that
very different species, the Gangrenous Angina,
the ancient authors are nearly barren<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">{137}</a></span>
of information: some years this is epidemick
and contagious in different parts of our
island; and is much more inimical to childhood
and adolescence than to adults; discharging
its venom on schools, and the
younger branches of families.</p>

<p>The principal differences in inflammatory
angina are in the parts affected, and
the degrees of inflammation; which may
be in one or in both sides; and variously
extended over the mucous membrane of the
fauces, tonsils, velum, uvula, pharynx, and
larynx. The usual symptoms are difficulty
and pain in deglutition, and sometimes in
respiration; internal intumescence and redness
of the fauces, stiffness of the neck, and
the lower jaw moved with pain; frequent
and difficult in excreation of viscid mucus
and saliva, and clamminess of the mouth
and throat; impediment in the distinct articulation
of words and speech; noise and darting
pain in the ears; flushed face, prominent
eyes; quick, strong, and hard pulse; anxiety,
restlessness; sometimes considerable contiguous
tumor externally; and in violent inflammation,
necessity of an erect posture of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">{138}</a></span>
the head, to prevent suffocation: the more
the pharynx is affected, deglutition is proportionally
interrupted; and some cannot swallow
food or liquids during several days. The
crisis is in a few days, at the utmost in a
week or two, by resolution, or by suppuration;
seldom or ever by gangrene.  Resolution
or discussion is accompanied with copious
excreation and salivation; and frequently
with critical perspiration, sweats,
urine.  Suppuration may be artificially discharged,
or may spontaneously burst internally
or externally. With judicious and opportune
assistance, there is trifling danger.
When fatal, it is by suffocation.  The predisposing
and occasional <i>causes</i> are cold air inspired
cold and moist air: perspiration suddenly
checked, especially on the neck; cold
water drank when the body is heated: epidemical
influence of the air and seasons.</p>

<p>Inflammation principally attached to the
muscles of the os hyoides, glottis, larynx, and
trachea, is fortunately far less frequent than
the former. In this, the current of air being
intercepted, there is necessarily difficulty and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">{139}</a></span>
pain in respiration, quick short breathing,
sense of strangulation, great anxiety and restlessness;
acute squeaking or ringing sound
of the voice; quick and irregular pulse. Of
that disease, which at least in symptoms has
considerable analogy with the present, and
called with us the Croup, we are hereafter to
treat.  We may here, however, with propriety,
subjoin two other inflammations, the
Angina Parotidea, and the Glossitis.  The
Angina Parotidea is often epidemick, but not
dangerous. It commences as a glandular tumor
externally, at the articulation of the
lower jaw, becoming gradually more enlarged
and unequally diffused, increasing to the
fourth day, and from thence declining: and
often is succeeded by swelling of the male
testicles, or of the female breasts. The Glossitis
is rarely a primary disease; but mostly
complicated with angina, or venereal salivation.
Its symptoms are obvious; pain and
swelling of the tongue; speech and deglutition
exercised with difficulty, headach, restlessness,
flow of saliva. If violent in the extreme,
there is danger of suffocation or starving.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">{140}</a></span></p>

<p>The strong cardinal outlines in the features
of Angina Gangrenosa are, symptoms of nervous
and putrid fever, with ulcerations in the
tonsils. Upon these we shall enlarge in their
rotine and detail: soreness or uneasiness in
the fauces and throat; stiffness of the neck;
headach, nausea, and vomiting; the fauces
and tonsils inflamed, but seldom in any considerable
degree, of a shining crimson colour,
with ash-coloured spots on the tonsils,
and sloughs, forming soon into corroding
ulcers; some pain is felt in deglutition;
there is sudden prostration of
strength; depression of spirits; anxiety and
oppression at the breast; small, quick, and
fluttering pulse; dizziness in the head; slight
delirium, especially at the nocturnal exacerbation;
heavy, red, and watery eyes; the
tongue foul at the root; in some the voice
hoarse; and in most the nostrils excoriated by
a sharp defluxion; the breath unusually fetid,
and generally the fecal discharge: the external
tumor of the fauces, when visible, which,
so far as my experience reaches, was rarely
the case, is edematous, indenting by pressure.
In most cases there is a cutaneous efflorescence
overspreading the face, neck, and other parts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">{141}</a></span>
of the body, in small points, scarcely eminent,
or in confused and confluent blotches: the
period of this eruption and of its duration
varies; and with its recedence there is desquamation
of the cuticle.</p>

<p>This is infinitely more dangerous than the
inflammatory angina, terminating salutary or
fatal from the third to the seventh day, according
to the degrees of virulence and medical
aid. Alarming symptoms are, great debility;
cutaneous petechiæ; the internal functions
of the brain much deranged; weak,
quick, fluttering, and irregular pulse; livid
colour of the ulcers; refusal of drink and
medicine; together with the other inauspicious
symptoms enumerated under febrile
prognosticks in general. I have seen not
only petechiæ, but also putrescent hemorrhages
from the nose and gums in this disease.
At the crisis there are often fetid stools; but
whether critical, or from the acrid matter swallowed,
may be disputed. General sweats and excreation
of the ulcerous sloughs are favourable
omens. By the speedy and judicious assistance of
remedies and regimen, very few, compared to
the sick and infected, sink. It is epidemick and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">{142}</a></span>
contagious: but of the source or nature of
the contagion, we are unacquainted.</p>

<h3 class="header"><i>Inflammation of the Lungs and Organs of
Respiration</i>,</h3> <p class="header">is a frequent inflammation in
northern climates; and most so in spring, autumn,
and winter; when the body, hydraulick
canals, and blood are in a state of inflammatory
diathesis: it generally encounters
the robust vigorous constitution, those of
strong muscular fibre, and dense rich blood;
the athletick rustick, manufacturer, and artizan;
those in the prime, and in all the intervals
between twenty and the decline of life: it
is very rare in infancy, as in idiopathick disease,
and seldom under puberty, or in old age.
It is most universal amongst the male sex;
and in all probability, both more universal
and destructive amongst the necessitous laborious
mass of the community. We also read
in authors, of spring pleurisies as no unusual
affliction in some climates considerably nearer
to the equator than ours. I apprehend, that
in the London registers the mortality by pulmonick
inflammation is under-rated, and perhaps
delegated to imposthume and consumption.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">{143}</a></span></p>

<p>Nosologists have enumerated several extraneous
symptoms as complicated species of
pleurisy and peripneumony; such as bilious,
erysipelatous, catarrhal, rheumatick, intercostal,
arthritick, verminous, flatulent, scorbutick,
putrid, and malignant: most of
which are merely symptomatick: for neither
rheumatick pains in the intercostal muscles,
nor flatulence pent up in the intestines, can
impose on medical discernment as genuine
pleurisy. The primary seat of pulmonick inflammation,
whether in the parenchyma or
internal viscus, or in its investing membranes,
is not clearly established in medical diagnosticks;
and therefore we comprehend pleurisy
and peripneumony under one genus:
in most cases they are complicated; and it
is now doubted whether any pure peripneumony
occurs without the pleura also participating
in the affliction. The inflammation
confined to the pleura alone, was described
as unaccompanied with expectoration;
hence the distinction of dry and humid species;
and in genuine pleurisy the pain was
represented as more acute than in peripneumony.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">{144}</a></span></p>

<p>The symptoms of pulmonick inflammation
are fever, darting pungent pain fixed like
a dagger in some part of the chest, the side,
breast, or back; and sometimes shooting to
the scapula and clavicle: sometimes the pain
is more dull and obtuse; and its situation
oftenest in the side, about the middle of the
ribs, between the sternum and spine; and
commonly confined to one lobe. At the invasion
there is shivering, restlessness, anxiety,
succeeded by heat: hot accelerated laborious
respiration; load and oppression at the
breast; urgent, short, and painful cough;
and very early in the disease more or less
expectoration, streaked with blood; the pain
is exasperated by inspiration and coughing,
and mostly fixed, but sometimes veering or
shifting: the pulse quick, full, hard, and
tense, like a stretched chord; the blood drawn
forms a buffy tenacious crust on the coagulum;
the urine is of a florid colour: from
the violence of pain, patients are often unable
to lay on either side, but compelled to recline
half-erect on their backs: when the
inflammation is violent, or both pulmonick
lobes assailed, there is inexpressible anxiety
and struggle in respiration, florid countenance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">{145}</a></span>
prominent eyes; with other symptoms
of obstructed circulation, and return
of blood from the head, and menacing suffocation.
In the advanced or dangerous stage
of the disease, the pulse is weak, soft, and
irregular. Sometimes there is nausea of
the stomach; and sometimes delirium.</p>

<p>The termination of pulmonick inflammation
is by resolution, by suppuration, by
gangrene, by fatal effusion of blood, or exudation
of coagulable lymph into the cellular
texture. Favourable symptoms are,
as in anginous excreation, facility in expectoration,
without much exertion or coughing,
copious, of due consistence, a little yellow,
white, thick, slightly streaked with
blood; the sooner this is concocted and excreted,
the sooner is the crisis; less urgent
and painful cough; freer breathing; abatement
in the heat of the body and velocity of
the pulse; general perspiration; deposition
of sediment in the urine; nasal hemorrhage;
dispersion of the pain, hitherto fixed in the
thorax, about the shoulders, back, or arms;
erysipelas in some external part; pustular
eruption about the breast, neck, and scapulæ;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">{146}</a></span>
abscesses in different parts. A crisis, when
favourable, always ensues within seven, or
at the utmost fourteen days; and after such
crisis, expectoration may continue copious
several days.</p>

<p>Inauspicious symptoms are, the respiration
struggling and laborious in the extreme;
dry pertinacious cough; no expectoration,
or with difficulty; suppressed expectoration;
obtuse pain, with difficult respiration; frequent
violent cough exasperating the pain;
the pain changing from one side into the
other; the pulmonick lobes in both sides inflamed;
the breathing intolerable and suffocating,
except in an erect posture, and even
then with laborious anxiety; the face turgid
and florid, or pale, with features of consternation;
violent headach; delirium; remission
succeeded by relapse; excessive sweats;
dry skin; weak, soft, and irregular pulse;
sudden cessation of pain; grumous livid expectoration;
rattling noise in the thorax, as
if plugged up by phlegm; dejected countenance,
squalid sunk eyes; great prostration
of strength; cold clammy partial sweats;
limpid urine; florid blood coughed up, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">{147}</a></span>
white and glutinous matter resembling the
branches of blood-vessels. Effusion of blood,
and exudation of coagulable lymph into the
pulmonary cellular texture, bronchial vesicles
and air-pipes, is more frequently than gangrene,
the cause of suffocation and death.
The occurrence of either is seldom later than
fourteen days. There is also great danger
of pulmonick inflammation, persevering beyond
seven or, at the utmost, fourteen days,
and without any considerable remission or
signs of resolution, terminating in suppuration;
of which the diagnosticks are hereafter
marked. Authors have likewise described a
malignant peripneumony, which seems to be
a complication of the preceding deleterious
symptoms, and of putrid fever.</p>

<p>There is, however, a species of pulmonick
affliction, the specifick diagnosticks of
which it would be unpardonable to omit;
because it has often and fatally been either
confounded with, and treated as genuine
pulmonick inflammation, or slighted as a
catarrh. This is named Peripneumonia Notha;
whose symptoms, at the onset, are ambiguous.
It is most frequent in persons old,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">{148}</a></span>
phlegmatick, fat, weak, emaciated, subject to
catarrh, addicted to fermented and spirituous
liquors; and in foggy weather and rainy winters.
It appears in the same seasons with genuine
pulmonick inflammation, and with catarrh;
that is, in spring and autumn; and frequently
under the veil of a violent catarrh.
The fever and heat are inconsiderable; the
pulse not hard nor tense; but there is straitness
and difficulty of breathing, and load at the
breast, with anxiety and gasping for breath;
urgent violent cough, with some expectoration,
and sometimes exciting vomiting; giddiness
of the head; rending headach; sometimes
drowsiness. It is sometimes suddenly
and unexpectedly aggravated, and suffocates
the patient.</p>

<p>The predisposing and occasional <i>causes</i> of
pulmonick inflammation are, epidemick state
of the air; sudden vicissitudes of the seasons
and weather from heat to cold; sudden suppression
of perspiration, or of pulmonary exhalation;
inspiration of cold air; sudden exposure
to keen cold air, especially after breathing
in a warm room, or drinking warm liquors;
cold liquors drank when the body is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">{149}</a></span>
heated; intemperance and sottishness, particularly
in spirituous liquors; dry cold winds;
strong muscular exercise, or manual labour;
repulsion of cutaneous eruption, febrile or
chronic; exsiccation of old ulcers; suppression
of habitual evacuation and eruption;
translation to and deposition of morbid matter
on the lungs; consequence and dregs of small
pox and measles; symptomatick from some
other diseases.</p>

<p>Inflammations of the heart, mediastinum,
and diaphragm, as solitary, are very rare diseases.
The symptoms of Carditis are severe
fever; pain and anxiety in the region of the
heart; difficulty of breathing; cough; irregular
pulse; palpitation, syncope. Inflammation
of the diaphragm, paraphrenitis: the
symptoms are, acute fever, intense pain in
the breast darting to the back, and increased
by inspiration, coughing and sneezing, and by
natural exertion at stool and urine; restlessness,
anxiety, dry cough, quick convulsive
breathing; sneezing, hiccup, nausea, vomiting;
compulsive painful grin on the countenance,
delirium. When it occurs, it is generally
complicated with inflammation of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">{150}</a></span>
adjacent organs, in either the thorax or the
abdomen. As the heart is the main spring of
the blood’s circulation, and the diaphragm the
principal agent in respiration, it is evident
that inflammation in either must be extremely
dangerous.</p>

<h3 class="header"><i>Inflammation of the Liver</i>,</h3> <p class="header">hepatitis, acute
and chronic. Both species are much more
frequent in tropical climates and warm regions,
than in northern and cold; and more
so in the former during the hottest seasons
of the year. The sensibility of the liver being
dull, its inflammation is less painful than
that of any other viscus. The symptoms
are, fever, pain in the right side under the
false ribs, and felt at the corresponding clavicle,
scapula, and hand; sensation of heat and
heaviness in the hepatick region; difficulty
of breathing, more especially when the inflammation
invests the superior convex part
of the liver; there is often dry cough; nausea,
bilious vomiting, and diarrhœa; the
urine of a fiery or saffron-colour; and generally,
but not always, the eyes, countenance,
and skin more or less of a jaundice tinge;
the pulse not remarkably disturbed; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">{151}</a></span>
thirst. Sometimes hepatick inflammation is
entangled with that of some contiguous organs
of the lungs or abdomen, and with their
respective features. The acute hepatitis, but
not the chronic, is usually terminated in a
few days, at the utmost fourteen or twenty-one,
by discussion, suppuration, or gangrene.
Critical resolution may be variously accompanied
with bilious diarrhœa and urine, nasal
or hemorrhoidal hemorrhage, copious bilious
sweats. Suppuration is not an unfrequent
termination: after which many survive,
but with difficult and slow recovery.
The purulency may be expurgated by absorption,
by the biliary ducts, by erosion of the
abdominal muscles, or by an artificial opening
when the abscess is perceptible externally;
and sometimes it erodes the diaphragm and
lungs.</p>

<p>The predisposing and occasional <i>causes</i> are,
burning climates; acrid viscid bile; the
blood tenacious and glutinous in consistence;
calculi, steatome, worms in the biliary
ducts; bilious vomiting; sudden refrigeration
of the body when heated, and obstructed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">{152}</a></span>
perspiration; thirst, and not sufficient
dilution of the blood; intoxication and abuse
of spirituous liquors; poisons; external injuries;
violent exercise; passions of mind;
inveterate hypochondriasm; translation of
purulent matter to the liver; symptomatick.</p>

<p>Inflammation of the Spleen is a rare occurrence:
schirrus of that organ is far more frequent.
The Peritonitis is also an uncommon
inflammatory vagrant: it will be revived
hereafter under Puerperal Fever.</p>

<h3 class="header"><i>Inflammation of the stomach</i>,</h3> <p class="header">gastritis. Notwithstanding
the incessant irritation and distinction
of this sensible organ, by innumerable
varieties of food and drink, yet its inflammation
is a rare event. The symptoms,
acute fever; fixed burning pain and
heat in the region of the stomach, aggravated
by pressure; frequent nausea and vomiting
after taking any nourishment; anxiety,
restlessness; weak, hard, intermittent
pulse; frequently delirium; universal debility.
It may prove fatal in the space of a
few days, or even of a few hours: there are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">{153}</a></span>
different gradations of severity and danger.
The termination is by resolution, suppuration,
gangrene. The predisposing and occasional
<i>causes</i> are, all the causes of topical inflammations
in general; poisons swallowed;
cold water, ices, and fruits swallowed when
the body is much heated; repletion from
food and gormandizing; crude and difficultly
digested nutriment; violent agitation
of body or mind; external injuries: from
repelled gout very rarely.</p>

<p>The three succeeding genera of the phlogistick
tribe, so far as respects mere inflammation
only, affect the external parts and
circumference of the body, and do not suppurate.
In other respects there is a distinct
tripartite separation, both as to general outlines
and minuter shades.</p>

<h3 class="header"><i>Erysipelas</i>,</h3> <p class="header">ignis sanct. antonii: gutta rosacea,
zoster, zona, herpes. Some trifling
pillage by this disease is noticed in the London
bills. To adults it is most hostile. The
symptoms are, more or less fever; superficial
inflammation of some portion of the skin and
cuticular membrane, with pain, tumefaction,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">{154}</a></span>
burning heat, redness, and pruriency, like
that from nettles; and variously, in different
persons, assailing the face, the neck, the
trunk, or one of the extremities: the eruption
seldom appears until after the commencement
of the febrile commotion; and
often from a small point spreads gradually:
it never rises to any conical eminence, nor
suppurates, but often excites vesications;
and if on the face and violent, blocks up the
eyelids: the pulse is frequently full and
hard; and with the eruptive expulsion the
fever and heat do not cease. It is sometimes
critical and salutary: the favourable crisis is
usually in a few days, or within nine, by
perspiration, urine, and desquamation of the
inflamed cuticle; and sometimes without
any perceptible revulsion to the excretories.
Some have this cutaneous inflammation annually,
or oftener, or at wider intervals;
and those once affected, are more obnoxious
to its returns. Presages of danger are, violent
inflammation and intumescence on the
face, or sometimes even on the legs, particularly
in old age, or unsound constitutions;
premature retrocession of the eruption; pale
colour; frequent return, and repetition of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">{155}</a></span>
the inflammation; delirium; coma; gangrene.
On the legs it sometimes leaves behind
a chronic enlargement. The zoster
and zona is a species of erysipelatous inflammation,
a hand’s breadth or more, affecting
the breast, sides, or abdomen, and various in
length.</p>

<p>The predisposing and occasional <i>causes</i> of
Erysipelas are, epidemick influence of the
air; obstructed perspiration; sudden refrigeration
of the body when heated; plethora;
suppressed evacuations, natural or artificial;
luxurious living and indolence; intemperance;
spirituous liquors in excess; poisons;
unsound constitutions; contusions, wounds,
burns, punctured nerves, blisters, acrids;
dregs of fevers; scorbutick; lunar influence;
passions of mind.</p>

<h3 class="header"><i>Rheumatism, acute and chronic.</i></h3> <p class="header">From the
Chart of diseases we may rank rheumatism
as an inferior piratical foe amongst the morbid
host; or rather as a scourge and instrument
of torture than of execution. In the
acute or chronic form, multitudes are molested
by it, especially in this island, and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">{156}</a></span>
northern regions: and more so in winter,
in spring, and autumn, and the interchanges
of the seasons: it seldom molests very
young or aged persons: adults are most annoyed
by it; the male more than the female
sex; the poor and indigent more than
the affluent; and those most who are exposed
to the inclemency and vicissitudes of
the seasons and weather: hence, during war,
soldiers and sailors are much more afflicted
with it than in peace.</p>

<p>In the acute rheumatism, fever may commence
before or after the pain, which variously
and alternately seems to dilacerate different
parts, especially about the joints of the
ancles, knees, hips, shoulders, elbows, and
wrists, sometimes the trunk; but rarely the
small joints of the toes or fingers: and commonly
succeeded by swelling and redness of
the distracted joints, and with restlessness:
at night the pains are exasperated, and often
suddenly abating in one joint, seize upon
another; thus harassing the body with a
war of posts. In its diagnostic train also are,
hard quick pulse, sizy blood, inflammatory
urine; sweats sometimes copious, but not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">{157}</a></span>
critical. Its continuance may be one, two,
or three weeks; by which time the fever, if
not mismanaged, abates with the pains: it
very rarely terminates in suppuration, and in
this instance resembles erysipelas and gout.
The crisis of the acute is generally by sweats,
cuticular efflorescence, nasal hemorrhage. It
may terminate inauspiciously in chronic
pains, or in consumption: indeed, emaciation
is always a consequence.</p>

<p>Chronic rheumatism may occupy all the
stations of the acute: in the hips it is called
ischias, morbus coxendicis, and sciatica:
in the loins, lumbago. In this there is
no fever, redness, nor swelling, only pain
and often inability to move the affected
joints; and this aggravated by change of
weather and cold. In the lumbago there
is direful pain about the loins, with difficulty
in erecting the trunk; but not, as in
the nephritis, accompanied with nausea or
vomiting, nor pain of the ureters, testicles,
or thighs. In the ischias there is severe
fixed pain about the hips, os sacrum, and pubis,
and often extending down the thigh and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">{158}</a></span>
leg along the fascia aponeurotica; with
difficulty or incapacity of moving the thigh;
and sometimes atrophy of that extremity,
or sciatic tabes. Chronic rheumatism may
harass months, years, with various degrees
of severity and exacerbation, and interludes
of ease; and is often extremely obstinate
and difficult to be dislodged. In many instances
also, we observe a contrariety and
dilemma whether to affix the name of chronic
rheumatism or gout to such pains. In
general, rheumatic aches are not so periodical
in their returns; and in several other
features the two diseases divaricate.</p>

<p>The predisposing and occasional <i>causes</i> of
acute and chronic rheumatism, idiopathic and
symptomatick, are, sudden suppression of
perspiration; sudden heats and colds; cold
damp night air, beds, houses, habitations,
want of sufficient warm cloathing and fuel in
rigorous seasons, or during the interchanges
of the seasons; wet cloaths; exposure to
heats and colds; sudden vicissitudes of heat
and cold; change of winds and weather;
one part of the body exposed to cold whilst
the other part is heated; sleeping on damp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">{159}</a></span>
ground; plethora; impure blood; repelled
eruption; suppressed evacuations; habitual
intoxication; intermittent; dregs of fever;
arthritic; hereditary; scorbutick; hysterical;
venereal; noxious exhalation from lead
or mercury; excess of venery; tabes dorsalis;
aneurism of the descending aorta near
the loins; lifting great weights; internal abscess
and scirrhus; abscess, and caries at the
upper articulation of the thigh-bone; sprains;
luxation and fracture of its neck; diseases of
the coverings of the nerves, or of their medullary
substance, or of the muscular fibre.</p>

<h3 class="header"><i>Gout</i>,</h3> <p class="header">arthritis, podagra; acute, chronic,
regular, and irregular. Here we have no
foundation to accuse the elements, or the
invisible demons of disease: this malady either
immediately, or by hereditary descent,
is too often the natural castigation and penance
of voluptuousness and sensuality.
In the preceding century it was confounded
with sciatica in the London bills. During
the present century, there is a considerable
increase in arthritic mortality; but, compared
to some other of the morbid host, it
is a mere buccanier. Arthritic piracy must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">{160}</a></span>
solely be imputed to the assaults of chronic
gout, either gradually breaking down the
fabrick, or storming some of the internal
organs essential to life. It attacks principally
the male sex; sometimes, but rarely,
females; and of the latter those of robust
full habits, the viragines, luxurious, indolent,
corpulent, and generally after the final
menstrual cessation: the majority, from the
peculiarity in the female constitution, and
from superiority in temperance, are exempt.
It seldom attacks before middle age; generally
in the decline of life: the few exceptions
of its earlier occurrence are rare; and
in them it is usually by co-operation of hereditary,
and of remote exciting causes: in
adolescence, and before puberty, it would be
numbered amongst the medical miracles. It
harasses most those of robust, full, corpulent,
large frame and temperament, the voracious,
gormandizing, affluent, and pampered; more
of the patrician than the plebeian orders; more
of the literary and sedentary professions;
and, according to Sydenham, those of an
acute genius and intellectual eminence. The
active and industrious orders of every community;
those who are exercised in daily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">{161}</a></span>
corporeal labour, or who, from necessity, design,
custom, or religion, do not indulge to
excess in animal food, or in wine and fermented
liquors, are seldom arthritick martyrs.
Compared to the number afflicted, very
few die of gout; it has even been by some
considered as an omen of longevity: many,
subject to it, have reached the Mosaick goal.
It has been alledged, to render men more secure
from other diseases; and in some few
instances to expurgate and renovate a disordered
constitution. These observations,
however, must be restricted to regular gout
only, and recurring at distant intervals.</p>

<p>That periodical local pain and inflammation
called the regular arthritic paroxism
sometimes invades suddenly, without any
warning; but in general there are presages
of its approach, one or two days, or even
weeks; by ceasing of usual moisture on the
feet; coldness, numbness in the feet and
legs, enlargement of their veins, muscular
cramps; general torpor and languor;
restlessness; headach; depression of spirits;
impaired appetite; flatulence, indigestion,
cardialgy; costiveness. But frequently one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">{162}</a></span>
or two days preceding the paroxism, the appetite
is keener than usual. The regular
and recent paroxism commonly invades by
nocturnal surprize in bed, with pain in one
foot, usually the ball of the great toe, accompanied
with shivering, heat, and shortly
after, conspicuous glossy redness, tension, and
spreading tumor. The pain becomes often
so intense as to be compared to premeditated
dislocation, or to a dog tearing the
flesh and ligaments: and such is the exquisite
tenderness in the inflamed part and
foot, as not to be able to tolerate the slightest
touch or even weight of the bed-cloaths.
In this way there are more or less diurnal remissions
and exacerbations of pain; which,
after one, two, three, or four weeks, recedes
gradually and insensibly, together with the
redness and swelling; leaving the patient
who had been chained to a bed or couch,
in perfect health; and soon after, the foot
in the exercise of its former suppleness and
strength. Throughout the paroxism the
corporeal agony renders the mind more irritable
and irascible: the urine is acrid,
hot, turbid, and fabulous; in many, the
perspiration is fetid; and with both general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">{163}</a></span>
and local sweats, and desquamation of
the inflamed cuticle, the paroxism finally
evaporates. In vigorous constitutions the
paroxisms are sooner terminated: indications
of which are, sudden tumefaction,
throbbing pain, and frightful sleep. In
recent gout the pain is more severe than in
chronic; the paroxisms shorter, with longer
intervals; and <i>vice versa</i>. Pustular eruptions
on the foot sometimes carry off the
arthritic fuel.</p>

<p>At the beginning, the paroxisms are shorter,
and the periods more regular and distant;
at intervals of three or four years, or
longer: by degrees the intervals are progressively
reduced to two, to one; to two
paroxisms annually about the equinoxes
and solstices, and during the autumn, winter,
and spring; at the same time the paroxisms
are protracted to two or three months. At
length, in the chronic inveterate stages of the
disease the patient enjoys a very short respite;
some few of the enervated, perhaps
only two or three months during the
summer: the pains in the extremities are
then indeed less violent; but the stomach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">{164}</a></span>
is more disordered.  In recent gout, one
foot only is assaulted; by degrees both feet,
one after the other: and in the rooted state
of the disease it not only torments both feet
in succession, but capriciously deserts and
re-attacks various parts; the ancle, knee, elbow,
wrist; darting often with electrical
velocity and shocks through the nerves
and muscular fibres: thus, in a circle of
torture and litigious warfare, teazing the
arthritick victim.</p>

<p>When either the inflammation of the
joints has commenced in the usual manner,
but without an adequate degree of pain
and inflammation, or at least without continuing
the usual time, and precipitately
recedes, some internal organ is exposed in
its retreat and rebound. Or when the arthritick
fuel is occluded, and not ejected to
the feet, it will, according to the various
parts and organs affected, excite corresponding
vibrations and symptoms in the natural,
vital, and animal functions; as inappetency,
indigestion, nausea, vomiting, flatulence,
ventricular eructation, colick, diarrhœa, nephritis,
and urinary obstructions; difficult<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">{165}</a></span>
respiration, asthma, palpitation, fainting,
general debility, low spirits, hypochondriasm,
cramps and spasms in the muscles,
apoplexy, palsy. In dubious cases from
what source to derive such irregular alarms
and minatory explosion; if they happen
about the usual arthritic periods, and in
such temperaments, their origin may be
suspected: and it is of the highest moment
to know that they are rarely of an inflammatory
nature. After the disease has continued
many years with frequent reiterated
paroxisms the joints do not soon recover,
but continue weak and stiff. In many
cases, chalky and calculous concretions are
formed in the joints of the extremities, and
in the kidneys and urinary passages. Racked
by those combined tortures, the patient requires
the auxiliary aid of stuffed chairs,
flannel, and crutches.</p>

<p>The predisposing and occasional <i>causes</i>
are hereditary; inactive sedentary life, with
luxurious living and gormandizing, especially
on animal food; intemperance in
wine, spirituous or fermented liquors; early
or intemperate libations to Bacchus and Venus;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">{166}</a></span>
unremitting application to study or
business; sedentary life; nocturnal lucubrations;
disturbed sleep, cares, misfortunes,
vexation, depressing passions; ceasing of usual
exercise or labour; sudden transition
from an active to a sedentary life; coaches,
dissipation, luxury, effeminacy; sudden
violent changes in diet; plethora; suppressed
evacuations; profuse evacuations;
various causes of debility; indigestion from
quantity or quality of aliment.</p>

<h3 class="header"><i>Of internal suppuration</i></h3> <p class="header">in the lungs, liver,
stomach, intestines, kidneys. Pulmonick
suppuration, empyema, or vomica, may be
predicted from preceding inflammation,
without considerable remissions, the neglect
of effectual remedies, and no signs of
resolution by the efforts of nature or art, and
by remission of acute pain; the difficulty of
respiration and also cough continuing; with
frequent horrors and shivering, heat and hectic,
weight and throbbing in the side, laying
on the diseased side painful; dyspnœa aggravated
by a recumbent posture; disagreeable
taste in the tongue; thirst; fetid
breath; emaciation. It may burst in all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">{167}</a></span>
the intervals between fourteen and sixty days,
and either relieves or suffocates, or is gradually
expectorated: and sometimes, after absorption,
may be evacuated by diarrhœa or
urine: the purulent contents may also be
discharged upon the diaphragm, or between
the pleura and intercostal muscles. Sometimes
there are several small abscesses; and
too frequently the final termination is ulceration
and phthisis. Suppuration in the Liver
is a frequent consequence of previous inflammation,
and is not altogether so fatal as
some other internal abscesses. Its symptoms
are those in common with internal formation
of pus, horror and chilliness, hectic heat,
thirst, weight and load in that region, jaundice-colour
of the eyes. Sometimes the purulence
erodes the external integuments;
sometimes the diaphragm, lungs, or stomach;
sometimes is discharged by the biliary
ducts into the intestines, or absorbed and
washed away with the urine. Suppuration
in the stomach and intestines is rare. In the
kidneys, the general symptoms, with purulent
fetid urine: it may also burst externally;
or by slow ulceration and hectic, undermine
the constitution.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">{168}</a></span></p>

<p>Of <i>Internal Gangrene</i> in the lungs, stomach,
intestines, kidneys, liver. Pulmonick
gangrene from inflammation, is predicted by
sudden cessation of pain, without any benign
crisis: expectoration either suppressed, or yellow,
green, black, and fetid; hollow noise
in the breast during respiration; dejected
countenance; red and heavy eyes; foul and
black tongue; quick, languid, and intermittent
pulse; fetid urine, stools, and sweat;
hiccup; cold sweats; universal debility and
sinking of the vital powers.  From the preceding
symptoms, from those enumerated under
general febrile prognosticks, and from the
functions peculiar to the different diseased organs,
internal gangrene in whatsoever part
may be comprehended; and a minute detail
would be superfluous.</p>

<h2 class="header"><a name="Diseases_of_the_Lungs_and_Organs_of" id="Diseases_of_the_Lungs_and_Organs_of"></a><i><span class="first-word">Diseases</span> of the Lungs and Organs of
Respiration</i>,</h2> <p class="header">what extensive ruin do they
yet spread! In commenting upon these, I
shall, in a trifling degree, invert the prescribed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">{169}</a></span>
order and arrangement. Into this group are
concentrated pulmonick hemorrhage, pulmonary
phthisis, the various species of hectick,
atrophy and tabes, nervous, sciatick,
dorsal, and icterick; also asthma, dyspnœa
and cough, catarrh, hooping cough, croup.
Inflammation of these organs and spurious
peripneumony, have already been described.
These, therefore, constitute nearly the whole
combined pulmonick host, and likewise some
of those diseases closely connected with the
pneumonick machinery, or with several of its
general morbid symptoms.</p>

<p>Behold here one of the great caravans of
dead to the stygian ferry; and tottering myriads
crowding to the same shambles. View
the innumerable multitude of fable mourners
and weeping relations attending them in the
last melancholy offices of friendship, to that
eternal bourn, the grave! Every introspection
of general morbid registers, and the unanimous
observations of the medical profession,
concord in proclaiming the notoriety of the
consumptive throng, and their ruinous uncontroulable
domination. Notwithstanding
the prodigious improvement in the alphabet,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">{170}</a></span>
subordinate rudiments, and appendages of the
medical science, consumption as yet is one of
the great oligarchy of morbid and remorseless
tyrants. He would be intitled to every terrestrial
honour, and to posthumous apotheosis;
he would rival and eclipse the most
celebrated tyrannicides, and expurgators of
monsters, whether demi-gods, heroes, or
saints, who could dethrone or controul this
stationary monopolizer of human sacrifices,
and sheathe his deadly sword.</p>

<p>From one fifth to one sixth of all the
mortality in London, is from consumption;
which is nearly double to that even of small
pox. But consumption is a term too lax and
indefinite. Into this gulph, no doubt, are
thrown many febrile and slow hectick emaciations,
from infancy to old age, in both
sexes; and there are few diseases from acute
and chronic sources, especially in their fatal
termination, without emaciation. Consumptions
and dropsies are the final wreck of a
great variety of human maladies. In no two
other diseases are, what pathologists term
<i>Morbi a Morbis</i>, more apparent: and in multitudes
of such cases, morbid dissections often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">{171}</a></span>
detect the effect, and not the original cause.
How many of the genuine pulmonary phthisis
are consociated with this miscellaneous crowd,
is difficult to guess; but, from the concurrent
testimony of physicians, and of experience,
we may safely affirm a very large proportion.
There are few families in this kingdom
whom it has not, one time or other, plunged
into tears. Physicians on the continent
alledge, that phthisis is more prevalent in
Britain than in any other kingdom of Europe.</p>

<p>The next inquiry is, in what age, sex,
rank of life, season of the year, and whether
in city or country is consumption most predominant?
It has been, from the earliest
chronology, the universal echo and monotony
of medical writers, to mark the principal
consumptive age between 18 and 35. But,
with submission, I would considerably enlarge
its limits, including from birth to 5, and
from 20 to 60. No age or stage of life is
exempted; but we might “<i>a priori</i>,” and
from viewing the great and general scale of
mortality, assert, that between 5 and 20, a
considerable number cannot possibly be swept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">{172}</a></span>
away in the phthisical torrent. Nor do we
mean to invalidate the general aphorism, that
in the blossom and full maturity of vigour
and comeliness, phthisis is superlatively deleterious.
Between the sexes no distinction
seems to be made. I conceive, however, that
amongst the lower orders universally, and
more especially those penned up in the foul
atmosphere of cities, that phthisis is more
fatal than amongst those who browse in the
pure air of the country. In accommodation,
cloathing, noxious trades, &amp;c. the indigent
have the disadvantage; and during sickness,
from the same causes, their recovery is more
desperate.  With respect to seasons, winter
and autumn in our climate is the most pernicious
to pulmonick maladies.</p>

<h3 class="header"><i>Pulmonary Hemorrhage</i>,</h3> <p class="header">hæmoptysis, sputum
sanguinis. The lungs spungy pneumatick
and hydraulick organs, in themselves
passive; but by the contraction of the diaphragm
and intercostal muscles enlarging the
capacity of the thorax, this ventilator is alternately
distended with atmospheric air, and this
sonorous fluid again quickly expelled, with either
some noxious emanation from the body, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">{173}</a></span>
decomposition of its own vital principle. Half
the blood of the human body circulates thro’
this organ: its blood-vessels are numerous
and large, and rise immediately from the
heart; and it is incessantly in motion and
agitation.  When the body has nearly attained
its ultimate extension and altitude, pulmonary
hemorrhage is most predominant;
more especially in those of narrow thorax,
prominent scapulæ, red cheeks, and acute tone
of voice. Before the hemorrhage, there are
shivering, horror, heat, fever, weight, oppression,
pain and heat in the breast, difficulty
of breathing, titillation of the fauces, dry
cough, exspuition of florid blood in various
quantity, and slowly or suddenly, from ounces
to many pounds, or even quarts, in a few
days; but the latter is rare. It may soon
totally cease, or only intermit, and again return
at irregular intervals. Relapses are frequent
on any irregularity or intemperance;
on acceleration of the circulation, or expansion
from heat.</p>

<p>This hemorrhage is very seldom in such
quantities to prove precipitately fatal, unless
mismanaged. From Bleeding, at least in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">{174}</a></span>
London registers, there is petty spoliation.
Pulmonary hemorrhage is more frequently
the consumptive precursor. Malign omens
are an eruptive torrent; ulceration in the
lungs; fever renewed; pain in the breast;
difficulty of breathing; cough, hoarseness;
night sweats; peripneumony; visceral obstructions;
cachexy; old age; relapses. But
pulmonary hemorrhage from temporary obstructions
of the menses, or in pregnancy,
or periodical, or without load in the thorax,
or fever, are much less mischievous.</p>

<h3 class="header"><i>Pulmonary Phthisis.</i></h3> <p class="header">Not one hundredth
part of pulmonary consumptions commence
with hemorrhage. Phthisical lineaments are
emaciation, diurnal hectic fever, obstinate rebellious
cough, difficulty of breathing, and
usually some change in the voice. In the
beginning, phthisis often resembles a catarrh,
or stubborn cold; and in this insidious disguise
is too frequently slighted, or neglected:
but continuing longer than the usual catarrhal
period, without any considerable intermission,
and especially if in summer, are sufficient
grounds of alarm. In that, from tubercles,
there is frequent teazing dry cough, exasperated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">{175}</a></span>
at night; some difficulty of breathing,
and panting on ascending any eminence or
stairs, or on exercise; some emaciation and
weakness. By degrees, there is more or less
expectoration of viscid, yellow, greenish purulence,
intermixed, however, with natural
mucus, and in the progress streaked with
blood. Sooner or later, uneasiness in the
breast, inability to lay on one side, pain
in the side, or under the sternum, and aggravated
by inspiration and coughing.</p>

<p>The consuming hectic fever has generally
two exacerbations during the twenty-four
hours, about noon and night; with some
degree of chilliness and shivering, and increased
sensibility to cool air, notwithstanding
the skin is preternaturally hot; the palms
of the hands and soles of the feet burn; a
florid redness, or circumscribed spot is perceivable
in the cheeks; the other features are
partial sweats about the neck and breast,
particularly in the morning; disturbed sleep;
slender, hoarse, and obscure voice; quick
pulse; sometimes vomiting after meals;
thirst; salt taste in the mouth; cough and
expectoration, in frequency and quantity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">{176}</a></span>
varying in different persons; in some, there
is a very considerable discharge of purulency
from the lungs. Various ordeals have
been proposed for the distinction of mucus
from pus, or pulmonick ulceration. Mucus
is naturally more transparent, viscid,
and cohesive: pus always opake, more yellow
and greenish; the odour more disagreeable,
and the expectoration accompanied with
a hectick fever. The sinking or swimming
in water of the expectorated matter, is a
precarious symptom, as it depends on the
quantity of entangled air.</p>

<p>In this island, phthisis, especially from
tubercles not suppurated, may continue one,
two, or more years; appearing during the
winter and spring, and disappearing during
the summer. Other consumptions are much
more rapid; in the vernacular phrase, galloping
the patient to a skeleton in a few
months. Phthisical patients are rarely confined
to bed, until near the deplorable stages
and fatal termination. Some have even a
tolerable appetite; and the generality are
cheered with adulatory hopes of recovery to
the last extremity. The progressive encroachment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">{177}</a></span>
is evident, by increased debility,
emaciation, and partial sweats; edematous
ancles; diarrhœa; depilation; consumption
and melting away of the fat and muscular
flesh: at last sapless, and macerated into
ghosts, the twinkling vital snuff is extinguished.
It is, as yet, impossible for me
to apportion the comparative mortality and
recovery in real confirmed phthisis; nor
could I depend upon any of the general
registers which I carefully consulted
with this view. We may, however, venture
upon a gross estimate, by negative
proof. Exclusive of individual evidence,
and medical attestation, we might, by a
simple algebraic process out of any specified
number, with their mortal diseases, and
probable proportion of sick in each, sift out
the consumptive. At all events, it cannot
possibly be thought exaggeration to alledge,
that not one out of seven consumptive recover.
From hereditary entail, or tubercles,
it is still more desperate.</p>

<h3 class="header"><i>Species of Consumption</i></h3> <p class="header">are, hectick fever,
atrophy and tabes; nervous; icterick; dorsal.
Hectick fever and atrophy is described as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">{178}</a></span>
a very frequent and fatal disease of infants,
especially in cities; accompanied with emaciation,
often short dry cough, hot skin
and palms of the hands; quick pulse, thirst,
diurnal exacerbations, sickly countenance: in
some the abdomen is tense, tumid, and considerably
enlarged. In simple atrophy the
fever is not so acute; with tumid belly, irregular
fecal discharge; voraciousness, indigestion,
thirst, nocturnal sweats, unhealthy
countenance. Atrophy and nervous tabes are
confounded in medical diagnosticks: in
both there is emaciation; but no considerable
fever, cough, or difficulty of breathing;
impaired appetite and digestion; leucophlegmatic
sickly appearance, partial sweats;
general debility, and proneness to faint on
any exertion. Sometimes atrophy is circumscribed
to a particular part or member. The
icterick tabes is accompanied with symptoms
of jaundice; and probably, under several
disguises, is more frequent than medical
authors have represented.</p>

<p>Dorsal, or spermatick, is a particular tabes;
miserable spectacles of which are recorded
by the celebrated Tissot.  Its symptoms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">{179}</a></span>
are, emaciation, yet good appetite; pain
and weakness in the back and loins; disturbed
sleep, and frequently interrupted by
nocturnal dreams and pollution, either with
or without pleasure; weakness of the knees
and trembling of the muscles on the least
exercise; sometimes a sensation as of thorns
pricking the skin, and descending down the
spine; pale sickly countenance, livid circle
under the eye-lids; the feces and urine
excreted with some difficulty, and often either
with semen or prostate liquor. By
degrees, the appetite decays with indigestion,
hypochondriasm, melancholy; pains in
various parts, headach, lumbago, universal
debility, wasting of the penis, impotency
and blight of future progeny. Females
are not exempt from this disease; but
it is much more frequent amongst the male
sex, from the age of puberty through various
adult stages of life: the foundation
of it is often laid at schools; and in those
seminaries of vice, large cities: and in some
countries it is a more general habit of licentiousness
than in others.</p>

<h3 class="header"><i>Asthma.</i></h3> <p class="header">In the London bills, Asthma and
Tissick are forced into a connubial link: formerly
it was consumption and tissick, the
Italian name for consumption, and without
any mention of asthma. It would appear
by the London registers, that about one fortieth
part of the <i>memento mori’s</i> in church-yards
is from asthma; and its proportion to
consumptive mortality as 1 to 8. I have
every reason to believe that the funeral catalogue
in London is not, in any outrageous
degree, preternaturally overcharged with consumption
or asthma. As both these diseases
are properly excluded from in-patients of our
hospitals, I applied to one of the largest dispensaries
in London, the Aldersgate; in which
there is necessarily an overflow of both these
distempers; and with the intention of confronting
and irradiating the bills of mortality.
Almost every page of these books presented
Asthma in no inconsiderable number;
and above all, Phthisis, phthisis, phthisis,
towering with gigantic bulk.</p>

<p>There is, unfortunately, in medical books
such an exuberance of postulata, that I endeavoured
to ascertain from facts and numbers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">{184}</a></span>
the sex and age in which asthma is
most predominant; and also its absolute
mortality. For this purpose I extracted and
winnowed out of all the patients in the Aldersgate
Dispensary during seventeen years,
from 1770 to 1788, all the cases of asthma
and dyspnœa: the result is as follows. Out
of 70,000 patients, asthma and dyspnœa were
3,192; or one twenty-third of all the diseases;
of which there were of males, 1613;
females, 1536: dead, 169; relieved, 575:
discharged, 569: cured all the remainder.
The sundry ages of these were,—From birth
to 10 years, 36; from 10 to 20, 25; from
20 to 30, 161; from 30 to 40, 429; from
40 to 50, 882; from 50 to 60, 949; from
60 to 70, 596; from 70 to 80, and upwards,
114.</p>

<p>From the preceding valuable records, and
which, in this instance, happen to chime with
the gross of medical observations, we may
draw the following inferences: That in
infancy and adolescence there are very few
cases of asthma and dyspnœa: that these diseases
chiefly occur in middle age and the
decline of life: that more than one half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">{185}</a></span>
of them are reported as cured; the relieved
and discharged forming a neutral list,
numbers of whom were either surfeited with
medicines, or were discharged by their physicians
when despairing of a radical cure, or
fearful of their swelling the dead catalogue:
in sinking of which there is a universal
rivalship throughout our dispensaries and
hospitals. Some of them, probably, were
palliated, vamped, and amended; and indeed
many were aged, for whom it would
be unreasonable to expect a radical cure.
I conceive, that with a part of them we may
venture to double the dead list; which would
raise asthmatick mortality to one of ten.
But in the above estimate, what proportion
legitimate periodic asthma bears to the other
anhelations I could not fathom.</p>

<p>The term Asthma has been misapplied to
every species of dyspnœa: it strictly denotes
a chronic periodic difficulty of breathing, recurring
and exasperated in paroxisms; and,
at least in the intervals, without fever. Authors
have subdivided it into several species;
the spasmodic, convulsive, and periodical;
the dry, humid, continued, flatulent: and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">{186}</a></span>
from the gradations of difficulty in respiration,
dyspnœa, orthopnœa. The periodick
and spasmodick is the true disease. Generally,
the day preceding the paroxism there
is fulness of the stomach, impaired appetite,
flatulence, eructation, tightness, and
stricture about the breast, and difficulty of
respiration; sometimes dry cough; the diaphragm
descends with difficulty in inspiration:
these are all increased by wine, fires,
bed, and heat: the head is stupid, heavy,
with slight pain, drowsiness, languor, yawning,
restlessness of spirits; profuse excretion
of colourless urine.</p>

<p>Asthmatic paroxisms commonly invade
suddenly, or are greatly aggravated during
the night, with constriction in the breast,
anhelation and struggling in breathing, so
that all the muscles of the thorax and shoulders
are roused into action to enlarge the capacity
of the lungs: this difficulty is greatest
in inspiration: the patient is compelled
to sit erect, or recumbent in bed, panting for
breath, cool air, and drink; and can with
extreme difficulty cough, expectorate, or
speak: the respiration is slow, laborious,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">{187}</a></span>
wheezing, and sonorous; with painful propensity
to cough: from the interrupted circulation
of blood through the lungs, the
face and eyes are turgid and livid, in some
the face is pale and bloated; with headach,
somnolency; palpitation of the heart; weak
and intermittent pulse; internal burning
heat, and often cold extremities; eructation
and flatulence, sometimes vomiting; difficult
and sonorous deglutition; sweats; limpid
urine; restlessness, or disturbed sleep.
Some lay easier on one side than on the
other. Many are under the necessity to sit
erect in a chair during several days and
nights, gasping for breath, not daring to
repose in bed.  Should both lobes of the
lungs be equally constricted, the compound
offices of this pneumatick and hydraulick
organ will be obstructed, with more threatening
symptoms of suffocation and strangling.
A loaded stomach, close chambers, fires,
beds, wine, noxious smells, all aggravate the
paroxism.</p>

<p>In the duration, recurrence, intermission,
and remission, asthmatic paroxisms vary.
A few hours, or a few days, are the usual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">{188}</a></span>
limits of this pulmonick tumult. In the
beginning it continues only a few hours,
with a diurnal remission and nocturnal renovation:
in the chronic state, from two to
five days is the usual duration. As the paroxism
mitigates, there is flatulent explosion
upwards and downwards, often with fecal
discharge, and expectoration of mucus. The
intermissions are proportioned to the duration
of the paroxisms: the longer the paroxisms
the longer the intervals, and <i>vice versa</i>:
with a copious expectoration they sooner
terminate, and are less severe. Some have
had as many paroxisms in winter as in summer;
and in the country as in town. Floyer
had sixty in winter and twenty in summer:
the latter, as usual, were more violent, and
longer. During calm frosty weather asthmaticks
are most secure; but at all points of the
compass the paroxism may invade. Some find
more ease in the city than country; others,
in low ground than mountainous. Some are
never entirely liberated from dyspnœa, and
with periodical aggravations. Few, comparatively,
die immediately in the asthmatic paroxism:
numbers survive many years, even to the
goal of longevity, and, emaciation excepted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">{189}</a></span>
without considerable diminution of strength,
spirits, or appetite. After long continuance,
it seldom admits of a radical cure; but only
alleviation and respite. Its fatal terminations
are suffocation, apoplexy; pulmonick inflammation;
consumption, cachexy, partial
or general dropsy; polypi in the heart and
the large vessels.</p>

<p>The predisposing and occasional <i>causes</i> are
hereditary; original structure of the pneumonick
organs; narrow thorax; plethora; suppression
of habitual or natural evacuations,
and cutaneous eruptions, as menses, piles, old
ulcers, sweat of the feet; consequence of
catarrh and colds, and sudden suppression
of perspiration: serum, pituita in excess;
cachexy; dregs of fever, small pox, measles,
and pulmonick inflammation; pulmonick
tubercles; spasmodic stricture of the
diaphragm and bronchiæ; smoky rooms and
houses, especially with wood fires; noxious
mineral and metallic fumes, arsenical, nitrous,
sulphureous, saturnine; smoky atmosphere
of cities; pulverulent trades, as stonecutters,
lapidaries, millers, flax-dressers,
chimney-sweepers; fetid offensive smells;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">{190}</a></span>
sudden changes of weather and winds from
heavy to a light atmosphere, portending
storms, and especially snow; easterly winds;
fogs, with unsteadiness of weather and seasons;
possibly some secret alterations in the
electrick fluid, and affecting electrometers;
warm and moist air; errors and intemperance
in food and drink, and ingurgitation;
violent motion and agitation of body and of
mind; symptomatick in various diseases, as
hystericks, hypochondriasm, gout, pectoral
dropsy, empyema, polypi in the heart or
aorta; wounds of the lungs; diseases of the
liver and spleen.</p>

<h3 class="header"><i>Dyspnœa and Coughs</i></h3> <p class="header">are symptoms of many
diseases; and they are also primary, and very
general maladies, especially in this island.
It is true, we have here no compass to steer
by: these are an exploded banditti; a sort of
rebels to the symmetry of system, whose diagnosticks
and therapeuticks are as yet slovenly
and imperfectly noticed by medical
authors. From the universal connection of
the organs of respiration, their functions are
more or less interrupted by and warped with
other diseases and morbid symptoms. Many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">{191}</a></span>
of the chronic impediments in breathing,
and the broken-winded, may be called asthmatic
excrescences, without its periodical
paroxisms, exacerbations, and remissions;
and without any rapid emaciation or hectick:
they are spurious asthmas and chronic
catarrhs. All the parts about the fauces and
pharynx are crowded with mucous glands,
from which, as in angina and catarrh, there is
often a profuse secretion. Many persons advanced
in life, and the aged, have a large discharge
of mucus, variously, from the fauces,
pharynx, larynx, lungs, stomach; all requiring
frequent expectoration or hawking.
The predisposing and occasional <i>causes</i> are
many of those already enumerated under
consumption and asthma. To these may be
superadded cold pituitous temperament; air
hot, cold, weighty, light, moist, impure,
stagnant; changes and vicissitudes of the
winds; cold moist climate and atmosphere,
and especially in winter, autumn, and spring,
and interchanges of the seasons; sudden vicissitudes,
disorders and inconstancy of the surrounding
elements; suppressed perspiration,
and pulmonary exhalation; catarrhal defluxion
on the lungs, larynx, fauces; mucus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">{192}</a></span>
in excess, tenacious; faults in the mucus
glands and ducts; trachea too sensible or
irritable; calculi, chalky concretions, and
inspissated mucus in the larynx; vascular
or parenchymatous diseases of the lungs;
original faults of the lungs, bronchiæ, larynx;
wasted lungs; extravasated air; spasm
of the respiratory muscles; flatulent farinaceous
food, slimy food, and drink; weak or
foul stomach, voraciousness; infants swallowing
saliva; symptomatick in various diseases
of the thorax, as consumption, asthma,
empyema, polypus, aneurism, <i>cum multis
aliis</i>: symptomatick in various diseases of
the abdomen interrupting the play of the diaphragm;
as full stomach, flatulence; pregnancy;
dropsy; enlarged spleen or liver;
tympany; nephritis; worms; injured abdominal
muscles.</p>

<div class="force_p"><h3 class="header"><i>Catarrh</i>,</h3> <p class="header">colds, influenza, coryza, gravedo.
In our irregular climate, during the annual
revolution of the seasons, few escape slight
catarrhs and colds, to which all ages are
liable. That particular epidemick species
of erratick catarrh, called Influenza, has
sometimes spread suddenly over a kingdom,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">{193}</a></span>
and some the greatest part of Europe. In
no other epidemick do so few die in proportion
to the number infected. Its continuance
is generally short; and the little depredations
committed during its itinerant incursions,
are principally upon declining, consumptive,
asthmatick, those of diseased lungs,
worn out constitutions, and aged. In such
forlorn complaints, catarrhal influenza has
hastened the final dissolution sooner than it
would otherwise have happened. In some,
from neglect or irregularity, it has excited
consumption, or pulmonick inflammation:
in others, recovering from fevers, and convalescents
of various descriptions, it has occasioned
relapses. These observations are also
applicable to simple catarrh skirmishing in less
formidable inroads. Frequent relapses, from
imprudence, in persons of phthisical or asthmatic
constitutions, may expedite the inflammation
of latent tubercles; or in aged persons
subject to pituitous coughs, spurious
peripneumony.</p>

<p>Catarrhal symptoms are increased secretion
of mucus, from the membrane of the nose,
fauces, and bronchiæ, with slight fever. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">{194}</a></span>
generally begins with some difficulty of
breathing through the nose; dull pain and
weight in the forehead; oppression in moving
the eyes; distillation from the nose,
sometimes from the eyes, of a thin fluid, often
acrid, and exciting frequent sneezing;
lassitude and languor of the body and spirits;
sometimes shivering and heat, and
increased sensibility to cold air; hoarseness,
soreness of the trachea and fauces, with some
difficulty of breathing, frequent cough and
irritation at the glottis, at first dry; sometimes
slight inflammation or angina, and
pains resembling rheumatic about the neck
and head. In some, the appetite is impaired,
but not considerably; but in all
the smell and taste. By degrees, the cough
and sternutation are accompanied with a copious
excretion of mucus, progressively
incrassating, with less laborious efforts of
coughing and hawking. Some catarrhs or
colds, affect principally the membrane of
the nose, and the different sinusses or cavities
communicating with that emunctory;
wherein stagnating mucus becomes more tenacious:
others are lower situated in the fauces,
pharynx, and trachea. Catarrh seldom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">{195}</a></span>
continues beyond a few days, or weeks: that
from contagion is more febrile and chronic.
The predisposing and occasional <i>causes</i> are,
cutaneous perspiration and pulmonary exhalation
suddenly checked; cold moist atmosphere;
sudden atmospheric changes; cold
habitations and beds; wet feet; head or
breast exposed or naked, thin ragged clothing;
excessive effeminacy and warm rooms;
epidemick state of the air.</p></div>

<h3 class="header"><i>Hooping Cough</i>,</h3> <p class="header">chincough, tussis convulsiva,
epidemick, and contagious: is generally
prevalent in infancy and adolescence,
and but once in life: adults are
rarely afflicted with it; and it is not confined
to any particular season of the year.
In the London registers, hooping cough and
cough are confounded, and conjointly make
no inconsiderable augmentation to the funerals.
By the records of Dr. Armstrong
in the dispensary of infant poor, of 732
cases of hooping cough, only 25 died; that
is, about 3½ <i>per cent.</i> or 1 of 33. But this
is too favourable a representation as a general
scale of mortality. Its beginning resembles
a slight catarrh continuing some days,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">{196}</a></span>
or one, two, and three weeks before the formation
and maturity of the convulsive paroxisms.
These consist of many successive
expiratory motions, so as to exhaust the
lungs of air, succeeded by a full inspiration
and pulmonick gulp, which rushing thro’
the glottis, makes a particular loud hooping
sound. The duration of these pneumonick
convulsive paroxisms, is from one to several
minutes, in which the child’s face is
turgid with blood, tears trickle down the
cheeks, and it seems almost in the agony
of suffocation and strangling.  At the termination
of each paroxism there is usually
some mucus expectoration and excreation:
this, at the beginning, is thin and not considerable;
but by degrees increases in quantity
and tenacity; and frequently at the
same time, the contents of the stomach are
evacuated.  The pneumonick convulsions
vary in their recurrence: they often return,
frequently in the course of twenty-four
hours, especially during the night: and thus
may continue to persecute from one to three
months, and sometimes a much longer space.
Throughout, the senses are not injured; nor
in the beginning the appetite; and in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">{197}</a></span>
intervals, children return to their amusements
as if nothing had happened.</p>

<p>The younger the child there is more danger;
as also in those born of phthisical or
asthmatic parents, or in a state of debility,
when seized with the hooping cough. When
it begins in the form of catarrh, and is attended
with fever, difficulty of breathing,
and little expectoration, it may prove fatal
in the early immature stages, unless the
convulsive cough supervenes, and with copious
expectoration.  After some continuance
of the disease, fever, with nocturnal
exacerbation and difficult respiration,
sometimes occur, and always with danger.
Some fall down in the paroxisms; others
have convulsions: violent paroxisms of
coughing have excited epilepsy, apoplexy, or
suffocation; but fever, dyspnœa, and pulmonic
inflammation are to be most dreaded.
With moderate expectoration the paroxisms
are neither frequent nor violent: but expectoration
in either extremes of scantiness
or excess are both unpropitious, more especially
with dyspnœa.  Paroxisms terminated
by vomiting, and succeeded by craving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">{198}</a></span>
for food, are favourable omens; and
recovery may be predicted by longer intervals
from coughing, and shorter paroxisms;
by restitution of natural appetite and respiration,
of tranquil sleep, of fecal excretion,
by evanescence of fever, and recruit of
strength. The predisposing and occasional
<i>causes</i> are, a certain epidemick state of the air
or specifick contagion, the nature of which,
and in truth of the disease beyond empirical
observation, are as yet very imperfectly understood.</p>

<h3 class="header"><i>Croup</i>,</h3> <p class="header">suffocatio stridula. This disease
has been particularly discriminated by modern
authors. It is principally inimical to
children, seldom until after ablactation; and
never after the age of twelve, or of puberty
at the utmost: it may attack the same child
more than once: it is most frequent in
winter and spring; and is not contagious nor
general amongst the community. It commonly
invades like a catarrh; and sometimes
with its own permanent features, which are
sudden paroxisms, as in spasmodic asthma,
of laborious struggling respiration, and
wheezing, as if the air-passage was straited;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">{199}</a></span>
hoarseness, and shrill ringing sound,
both in coughing and speaking, as if the
voice came through a brass tube; cough, if
any, dry, or with excreation of membranous
fibres; thirst, quick pulse, anxiety,
restlessness; and during the intervals, the
senses and appetite are unimpaired: sometimes
there is appearance, sometimes none,
of inflammation in the fauces. It is always
dangerous, infinitely more so than
the preceding disease: death may suddenly
ensue on the third, fourth, or fifth day,
and perhaps when no such event was suspected:
the impending hurricane may be
prognosticated by laborious struggling in
respiration, and symptoms of strangulation;
with anxiety, restlessness, quick weak pulse.</p>

<p>The predisposing and occasional <i>causes</i> are
yet the subject of litigation; whether inflammatory,
or spasmodick, or a combination of
both. On dissection, mucus accumulated has
been found lining the larynx, by degrees incrassating,
and interrupting the air from entering
the lungs. We require same additional
illumination on this subject.</p>

their affliction. We here treat of headach
as a primary disease; or at least as the

wretched. The London bills neither<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">{201}</a></span>

of one of the British poets, “that knocketh
man down as butcher felleth ox,” is principally
hostile to those advanced in years,
and the aged: to those more especially of
large heads and short necks, of corpulent
habits, indolent life; to the full feeders,
or the addicted to frequent intoxication.
Medical observations also represent it as
affecting more of the male than the female
sex; as more predominant in winter and
spring, especially on vernal heat succeeding
winter cold; or moist rainy weather supplanting
cold, and <i>vice versa</i>. It is also
said to be more general and fatal in the city
than the country.</p>

<p>Apoplexy may attack suddenly; in other
cases it is preceded days, weeks, or even
months before the shock by vertigo, obscure
vision, noise in the ears, dullness of
memory, faultering in the tongue, difficulty
of articulation; in some the mouth is distorted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">{205}</a></span>
with transient torpidness or tremor of
different muscular parts, headach, drowsiness,
night mare, nasal hemorrhage, flushing of
the cheeks, lachrymation, decay of strength,
alteration of countenance and voice. In the
paroxism the patient, instantaneously stunned,
falls down, with suspension of the
functions of the external and internal senses,
of voluntary motion, and of voice
and speech; and with muscular relaxation;
at the same time the pulse and respiration
remain nearly in the natural state, excepting
that there is generally a stertor in
breathing, resembling a profound sleep from
gross intoxication; and also, as in most soporous
diseases, the circulation slow. These
unmolested functions of the heart and lungs
distinguish it from syncope. In the duration
and severity of the symptoms, there are different
gradations. Some lay in this lethargic
state insensible to every object and impression:
some when spoke to, only groan
or make dumb signs: some, after a short
time, are able to articulate: in some, there
is froth at the mouth: the colour of the face
is various, sometimes flushed, sometimes
however pale; and the signs in authors between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">{206}</a></span>
the sanguine and serous apoplexy are
extremely ambiguous.</p>

<p>It often proves fatal at the first stroke;
few can survive many attacks. Death, recovery,
or transition into palsy, are generally
decided within seven days. In magnitude
of danger, perhaps no other disease can contend
with this formidable antagonist: but
I shall leave it to others to graduate the apoplectick
scale. Some recover; in others it
ends in death or hemiplegy, which is but a
sad alternative and capitulation for life: and
too frequently is accompanied with some
lesion of the mental functions. Even of those
who recover, they are in danger of relapses
from intemperance, and errors in the non-naturals.
The violence and contumacy of
the symptoms indicate the degrees of peril:
the less the functions of internal and external
sense, and of voluntary motion are
injured, our hopes are more flattering;
whereas total insensibility, froth at the
mouth, cold sweats on the breast and face,
cold breath, involuntary excretion of feces
and urine, are harbingers of impendent wreck
in the apoplectic whirlpool.</p></div>

<h3 class="header">Of lethargy, coma, carus, cataphora.</h3> <p class="header">
These denote different degrees of profound
deep sleep without delirium. Authors have
often confounded them with the febrile
class, especially the “<i>lusus naturæ</i>” of remittents.
To this irresistible torpor and
drowsiness, even at meals or in conversation,
many corpulent and fat persons are subject.
We also read in authors of some extraordinary
instances of profound long protracted
sleep, from which it was impossible effectually
to rouze the person. The vertigo has
also been distinguished into simplex, scotomia,
caduca. In this disease all objects, although
at rest, seem to whirl round; sometimes
with headach, flushing of the face,
noise in the ears; and if not supported, the
patient often falls down. It is commonly
fugacious, and momentary; seldom above
a minute; and in some diseases is symptomatick.
The prognostick may be deduced
from that of apoplexy.</p>

<p>Of the predisposing and occasional <i>causes</i>
of apoplexy, lethargy, coma, carus, cataphora,
and vertigo: hereditary; short neck;
plethora, general or partial, sanguine or serous,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">{208}</a></span>
especially sanguineous plethora in the
vessels of the brain; tight neckcloaths; pressure
on the descending aorta, cava; serous
or sanguineous exudations or extravasations
in the brain; compression of the medullary
substance, or of the origin of the nerves;
suppression of habitual evacuations or hemorrhages,
nasal or hemorrhoidal; habitual
venesection neglected; old ulcers dried up;
full and long continued inspiration loading
the vessels of the head; blood forced on the
brain by violent efforts of coughing, vomiting,
fecal expulsion, exercise, venery, stooping
the head; salivation suddenly suppressed
by cold; foul stomach, gluttony, surfeits,
luxurious living, and sedentary life; fatness,
corpulency; intoxication, sottish potations;
violent passions of mind irascible or stimulating,
and also depressing, as anger, ambition,
chronic melancholy and cares; intense
meditation and study; intemperate
lust in old age; noxious vapour from
liquors in fermentation, from charcoal,
quicklime, and new-plastered walls; particular
effluvia and odours concentrated in
large quantity; crowded rooms filled with
animal steams from the lungs; thunder;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">{209}</a></span>
sometimes epidemick state of the air and elements,
or perhaps celestial influences not yet
explained; intense cold; warm baths;
blood rarified and expanded; insolation; some
narcotick poisons, as opium, hyoscyamus, cicuta,
laurus, belladonna, and some fungi:
obstructed circulation through the lungs and
heart, from asthma, polypi, ossifications of
the large blood vessels or valves, and particularly
of the right ventricle; external injuries
of the head; concussion, fractures.
The most frequent cause is, accumulation
and congestion of blood in the brain: but
sometimes, on dissection, no disease is discernible;
and effusions in the brain do not always
inflict apoplexy.</p>

<h3 class="header">Of vertigo,</h3> <p class="header">the causes are several of those
just enumerated: the principal, plethora, suppressed
hemorrhages; suppressed perspiration;
luxurious diet, gluttony, somnolency; foul or
disordered stomach; costiveness; intoxication;
narcotick and tobacco fumes; unremitting
attention of mind to study or business;
restlessness, mental distress; hunger, inanition,
debility; obstructions and diseases in the

<h3 class="header"><i>Palsy.</i></h3> <p class="header">Paralysis, hemiplegia, paraplegia.
During the last thirty years of the preceding
century, paralytick mortality is only 630 in
the London bills; but in the present century
is doubled and trebled; and some part
of this surge can be readily accounted for by
the multiplication of the mechanical arts,
in which lead and quicksilver are employed.
At present, its mortality seems to stand in
the proportion of one third or fourth to
that of apoplexy. Of 310 patients afflicted
with palsy and hemiplegy, and admitted
in the course of 10 years into the Bath
hospital, 57 were cured; that is, 7 <i>per cent.</i>
or 1 of 15; there died 15, or 5 <i>per cent.</i>;
and the remainder were found incurable and
discharged, or received some trifling relief;
and several of these might be added to the
dead list. I doubt whether by the artillery
of the shops we are so successful against
this crippling foe.  A considerable number
of the community are rendered helpless and
decrepit from this disease; to which some
trades, more than others, are obnoxious; and
adults and aged infinitely more than the
young and adolescent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">{211}</a></span></p>

<p>Palsy and apoplexy often alternate, and
may then be termed one bicipitous disease.
Severe apoplectick strokes, if not immediately
fatal, frequently remit, and pass into palsy:
or the catastrophe may originate in hemiplegy,
which is the most frequent form of
palsy; and when fatal, it is through the apoplectick
explosion. In palsy there is more
or less diminution or privation of muscular
motion and feeling, without pain or fever,
or injury of appetite. This may affect the
muscles of voluntary and of involuntary motion;
the whole, or only a portion of each:
as muscular impotency of one side, or half
of the body; of one or both of the lower
or upper extremities; of some smaller portion
of the face, eyelids, tongue, œsophagus,
stomach, intestines, the sphincters of the
bladder and anus, the penis, bladder, kidneys,
heart. Under this deplorable calamity
many linger years; some confined like a shellfish,
and motionless; others crawling upon
crutches. Tremor may be ranked as an inferior
vassal of palsy.</p>

<p>The predisposing and occasional <i>causes</i>
of palsy are most of those of apoplexy; various<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">{212}</a></span>
diseases of the cerebrum, cerebellum,
and medulla oblongata; diseases of the inherent
muscular power; vapours from lead,
mercury, arsenick; colica saturnina; compression
of nerves; abscesses in the lumbar
vertebræ; falls, external injuries, blows on
the head or loins, luxations or sprains of the
lumbar vertebræ; spinal dropsy; fractures;
venery.  Of Tremor many of the causes
of apoplexy and palsy; hereditary; old age
and decay of the inherent nervous and muscular
energy; compression or obstruction of the
nerves; poisons; opium; employments in lead
and mercury; ebriety; suppressed evacuations;
sanguine plethora; repelled cutaneous
eruptions; lurking gout; general debility;
external injuries; warm fluids;
strong tea; excess of venery; long watching;
anxiety; passions of mind; sedentary
life; excessive evacuations.</p>

<h3 class="header"><i>Epilepsy.</i></h3> <p class="header">Morbus sacer, demoniacus, caducus,
falling-sickness. In the last thirty
years of the preceding century, thirty-five
deaths only are marked in the London bills
to epilepsy; and in the first forty-five years
of the present century, they dwindle to thirteen:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">{213}</a></span>
at present the title and disease is
omitted. Medical men know, that no inconsiderable
number of the community are
tormented with this frightful convulsion,
which the ancient Jews could only ascribe to
the malicious rancour of an infernal devil.
In this instance also, professional experience
and erudition must interfere and correct the
omissions of the publick registers. We are
certain, that epilepsy is much more destructive
to the springs of life: perhaps it
is cast by the reporters into either the apoplectick
or convulsive abyss. It is alledged
to be more frequent amongst the male than
female sex; and in infancy, in those of delicate
constitutions, lax habit, acute, nervous and
muscular irritability. <i>Vid.</i> <a href="#Page_370">Convulsions</a>.</p>

<p>In many cases there is no previous monitory
of the impending paroxisms; in some
other cases the lowering storm is portended
by lassitude, headach, giddiness, dimness of
sight, broken sleep, frightful dreams, restlessness,
terror, noise in the ears, palpitation
of the heart, unusual smells, murmuring of
the intestines, yawning, luminous flashes before
the eyes, profuse urinary excretion, sense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">{214}</a></span>
of the disease ascending from a particular part
to the head. By the epileptic whirlwind
the patient is suddenly and precipitously
thrown down, with suspension of the internal
and external senses, and universal convulsions
of the external muscles, or those
of voluntary motion: the muscles of the
head, face, eyes, and mouth, are particularly
agitated; the head is tolled in every direction,
the teeth grind against each other, the eyes
roll, the mouth emits froth and slaver; the
tongue, thrust out of the mouth, is often
wounded and lacerated by the teeth; the
respiration is as if through a noose on the
neck; the fingers are clinched into the
hand; there is perpetual involuntary deglutition,
palpitation of the heart, and sometimes
involuntary excretion of urine, semen,
or feces; the motions of the heart and of
respiration are hurried, but not otherwise interrupted
nor injured. Such is the powerful
coercive muscular contractions and convulsions,
that several strong assistants are requisite
to secure each member.  Some, at the
first struggle and uproar, emit hideous groans
or yells, resembling the bellowings of a wild
beast; others, a more still and savage murmur.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">{215}</a></span>
In most, the aspect is horrible: nor
does any other disease exhibit such truculent
spectacles of terror and abhorrence.</p>

<p>After some few minutes, very rarely hours,
a pacification ensues, and abdication of the
epileptic demon; and the patient liberated,
rises up of his own accord, languid, dejected,
and ashamed, with but few traces on the memory
of the preceding tragedy; and nearly
in the exercise of all his usual faculties;
which is not the case in apoplexy. In the
severity and duration, but still more in the
repetition of the paroxisms, there is prodigious
variation: in some they are erratick
and irregular; in others, they are periodical;
and at various intervals in diurnal paroxisms,
synchronous with the tides; monthly with
the lunar revolutions; equinoctial; annual.
It is often a chronic disease, and then, much
less inimical to life than might be expected
from such a universal commotion. But in
infancy, epilepsy and convulsions are the
most atrocious of the morbid murderers.
Sometimes it ceases after puberty. In old
persons, or where there is no previous warning
of the approaching paroxisms, the prospects
are deplorable: reiterated epileptic bombardment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">{216}</a></span>
often makes breaches in the internal
recesses of the senses; hence insanity,
apoplexy, palsy, idiotism. Authors have
attempted the diagnosticks of epileptic origin:
thus, in the brain, or its spinal elongation, it
is represented as invading with stupidity, or
hebetude of the internal and external senses;
headach, disturbed sleep, pale face; with
suddenness in the assault, without previous
warning, and a sort of sensation of distillation
from the head to the breast and stomach:
from nervous sympathy of the stomach and
intestines, and of the extremities, it is preceded
by disturbance of those parts at the
approaching paroxism; by an aura epileptica,
and ascending vapour, or extraordinary
sensation originating from some fixed point.
To conclude, this convulsion is sometimes
feigned by begging impostors.</p>

<p>The predisposing and occasional <i>causes</i>
are, hereditary, peculiar original organization,
especially of the brain and its appendages:
plethora, fright, terror, horror, anxiety and
passions of mind, excess of venery, study;
passionate drunken nurses; foul stomach;
acidity, acrid bile; worms, dentition, scald<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">{217}</a></span>
head, or ulcers rashly dried up or repelled;
external injuries of the head; various diseases
within the brain, or in the nervous
chords; ebriety; difficult parturition;
hystericks; cachexy, dregs of intermittent
fevers; irritability and sensibility in morbid
extreme; nervous sympathy and motory vibrations;
force of habit; offensive odours;
poisons, narcoticks. In those of epileptic
temperament and predisposition, paroxisms
are liable to be recalled by heat, ventricular
crudity, intoxication, anxiety and passions
of mind, terror, prospect of precipices, &amp;c.</p>

<h3 class="header"><i>Tetanus</i>,</h3> <p class="header">emprosthotonus, opisthotonus,
locked jaw, trismus. This is not a frequent
disease in this island, nor in Europe: it is far
more universal and fatal in the tropical regions,
and in the warmest seasons of those
zones. In such climates tetanus, and all the
train of spasmodick and convulsive diseases
rage with more inveterate rancour and devastation:
there the slightest wound or scratch
will frequently occasion a locked jaw. It
afflicts more adults than youth; and, as is reported,
more males than females. The emprosthotonus,
or head bent forward on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">{218}</a></span>
breast, is much less frequent than the reverse.
Its assault is sometimes sudden and violent;
but generally by slow approaches; and with
stiffness of the muscles of the back, neck,
and occiput; difficulty in rotating the head;
sense of uneasiness about the root of the
tongue; difficulty of swallowing, painful
spasm at the lower part of the sternum
darting to the back; spasm and rigidity
of the muscles of the neck and occiput pulling
the head backwards; and also of the muscles
of the lower jaw, locking the teeth together,
so that by the utmost force they cannot
be separated: the muscles also of the face,
eyes, and nose, are often violently distorted
with a hideous grin. By degrees, this spasmodic
conspiracy becomes more universal,
communicating to the spine, abdomen, and
extremities; and the contracted abdominal
muscles feel as a hard-board. In the spasms
there are repeated exacerbations, with excruciating
pain; followed by remissions or
transitory reprieves; but the latter seldom an
hour in duration: and sometimes with these
paroxisms, internal murmuring of the voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">{219}</a></span></p>

<p>Seldom any fever accompanies this spasm,
unless from cold; and in this case the disease
commences a few days after such accident:
but if from wounded nerves, frequently not
until some days after the lesion, and even
when the vulnerary pain and uneasiness was
removed. The external and internal senses
are seldom interrupted until the last and perilous
stages, when the brain shares in the
general disorder. But the natural functions
and also those of respiration and circulation
are unmolested. It may prove fatal in a
few hours; generally, if not relieved, in a
few days; and rarely is protracted beyond
fourteen. Until of late years, and the discovery
of more effectual remedies, few recovered.
Its danger is increased by the sudden
impetuosity of the assault; or from
wounded nerves: the final tragedy is closed
by convulsions.</p>

<p>Authors describe a spasm of the lower
jaw and tetanus of infants, which they term
Trismus: this is most frequent and dangerous
early after birth: the aperture of the
mouth and gums is contracted, and with
difficulty separable: its lips and mouth remain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">{220}</a></span>
nearly motionless, with contention
or impracticability in suction: and sometimes
the spasm becomes general amongst
the muscles.  I read in authors the diagnosticks
of another species of tetanus,
which they represent as not unfrequent in
the European regions, and especially amongst
infants; the symptoms agitation,
trembling, convulsions, distortion of the
lips, grinding of the teeth, difficulty of suction
and deglutition, regurgitation of milk
by the nose; the jaws locked together;
spastic respiration, and with groans; the
muscles of the neck rigid, with flushed face,
tumid abdomen, vomiting, fetid stools. This,
in some features, resembles what we term
Inward Spasms. In fact, the history and
accurate diagnosticks of infant diseases are
as yet imperfect.</p>

<p>The predisposing and occasional <i>causes</i> of
tetanus and its species, are wounds, particularly
of the fingers and toes; surgical operations,
fractures, luxations, burns, injuries of
a nervous tendinous and sensible part, bruised
testicle; suppuration, abscess; cold and moisture
applied to the body when heated; sudden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">{221}</a></span>
suppression of perspiration; sudden vicissitudes
of heat and cold; repletion, foul stomach and
intestines in infants; dentition; bile in the stomach;
worms; poisons; ebriety; excessive
evacuations, hemorrhages; suppressed salutary
evacuations, exanthemata and cutaneous
eruptions; abortion; difficult parturition;
violent mental emotion; angina; lurking
gout; hemorrhoides; hypochondriasm, hystericks,
melancholy. In many of these it
is merely symptomatick.</p>

<h3 class="header"><i>Spasms and cramps</i></h3> <p class="header">are idiopathick as well
as symptomatick; fugacious, or more fixed
and constant; and may affect various portions
of the external and of the internal muscular
fibres; of the head, neck, face, eye,
lower jaw, lips, arms, hands, fingers, thighs,
legs, feet, penis; the tongue, fauces, pharynx,
œsophagus, lungs, stomach, intestines,
kidneys, ureters, bladder. Fugitive cramps
in the legs excite excruciating pain, tumor
and rigidity of the muscle.</p>

This very uncommon disease may afflict either
of the sexes about the period of adolescence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">{222}</a></span>
and puberty; rarely afterwards. Its
symptoms are lameness of one leg, which,
when attempts are made to walk, is dragged
as if paralytick; and is then, more or less,
convulsed: at the same time, whenever the
patient attempts to convey any food or drink
to the mouth with the corresponding arm,
it is incessantly convulsed, with a rapid succession
of gesticulations. Some are even
compelled to dance, leap, run, sing, or laugh.
The paroxisms vary in duration and frequency:
sometimes they are terminated in
half an hour: sometimes they continue several
days, rarely a week, without intermission:
sometimes they recur several times
daily, leaving behind debility and weakness.
Delirium and a degree of fatuity are not
unusual in the paroxisms. The predisposing
and occasional <i>causes</i> are mostly unknown:
sometimes worms.</p></div>

placed by a spectator: the functions of internal
and external sensation are suspended;
the eyes are open; the countenance and
colour are nearly natural; the pulse and
respiration alone continue in motion, but
obscure. The duration of the paroxism is
from a minute to hours, very rarely days:
and the recovery as if from a profound sleep:
in some with confused ideas of surrounding
objects during the chasm. In the extasis
strange visions are seen: and of these
trances there are extraordinary instances on

asphyxia, idiopathick, symptomatick.
In syncope the action of the heart and of
respiration become considerably weaker than
usual, or for a short time suspended: the
pulse and breathing are sometimes so weak
as to be imperceptible; the countenance pale
and cold, with a clammy sweat, especially on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">{224}</a></span>
the forehead; the functions of external and
internal sense, and of voluntary motion, during
this vital chasm, are interrupted or suspended.
It sometimes arrests suddenly,
sometimes with preceding languor and anxiety
about the heart, giddiness, and dimness
of sight; objects are seen as through a mist,
sounds are scarcely audible; and there is confused noise in the ears.
In the gradation and duration of vital
suspension, there are diversities: after the
lapse of a few or more minutes they gradually
revive, yawning, sighing; some with vomiting;
and some without vestiges of reminiscence
during the temporary interreign. This
partial cessation of the vital functions distinguishes
it, at the first glance, from apoplexy.
Asphyxy is only a more violent degree
of syncope in which the intire human
machinery is stopped: the counterfeit of
death; but in which there are embers capable
of being fanned and vivified into vital
renovation. The first exertions towards
a restitution of the vital energy when suspended,
are sometimes with symptoms of
epilepsy and convulsions.</p>

Ossification.</i></h3> <p class="header">Polypi are solid coagulums of
blood, of a firm or fleshy consistence: aneurism
a distention and weakness in some portion
of the arterial coats, and partial enlargement
or bulge in the sanguineous canal;
the usual seat of the first is in the auricles
and ventricles; of the second, in the
large trunks, and more about their origin:
ossification of the valves, and of the aorta, or
the smaller branches, is more frequent in old
age. The symptoms of polypi and aneurism
are often ambiguous; most of them
are common to some other diseases; such
as difficulty of breathing, violent palpitation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">{228}</a></span>
of the heart, and anxiety aggravated
by the least motion, with propensity to faint,
intermittent pulse, pain under the sternum,
torpor of the arm, pale face, edematous ancles,
frightful dreams, timidity to walk
alone without support. These, together
with syncope and asphyxy, no doubt make
a part of the sudden deaths, and some other
casualties in the London bills.</p>

<p>I had nearly omitted the description of
two diseases in which we are not personally
interested; the Berbiers of Indostan,
and the Raphania, once a European meteor.
In the berbiers there is chronic tremulous
motion of the hands and feet, sometimes
of the whole body: at the same time pricking
and formication, and some degree of insensibility;
weakened voice; anhelation: it
usually originates from suppressed perspiration.
The raphania was once a transient epidemick,
and principally noxious to infants;
the symptoms stupor of the spine, sensation
of pricking pain in the muscular fibres;
the lower extremities rigid, sometimes convulsed;
eyes rigid and distorted; pharynx
constricted; tongue retracted.</p></div>

<h3 class="header"><i>Hypochondriasm</i>,</h3> <p class="header">hips, spleen, and vapours,
imaginary maladies. This chronic valetudinary
infatuation is very frequent in
our island: it occurs principally in the
adult and middle age; seldom early in life;
in the male more than in the female sex,
especially in those of melancholick temperaments;
and much more amongst persons
of independent fortunes, and amongst literary
and sedentary professions, than the exercised
and industrious. Vapours are often
complicated with diseases of the stomach,
hystericks, melancholy. But in the true
hypochondriasm, the valetudinary dyspepsy,
and diseases of the digestive organs, seem
rather a natural consequence and sequel of
the lugubrious mental temperament: besides,
in dyspepsy the mental perturbation
is slight; it is also a far more universal disease
than hypochondriasm, affecting equally
both sexes; and the young as well as the
old.</p>

<p>Hypochondriacks feel, or imagine they feel,
all diseases; against these they combat with
a thousand remedies, and exhaust the whole
pharmaceutical rotine.  They exaggerate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">{230}</a></span>
with minute narrative these morbid phantoms,
which no other person can perceive,
nor account for; examining their pulse, fatiguing
and harassing their physicians, visitors,
and domesticks; on the slightest
grounds haunted with apprehensive forebodings
of misfortunes, misery, and death; and
in the utmost anxiety about the event, at
the time perhaps that the appetite is not
much impaired: in most things, however,
their judgment is correct; their health and
diseases excepted, which are the constant
objects of their fears.</p>

<p>By such anxious solicitude, and passive
submission to fanciful and imperative chimeras,
a luxuriant brood of symptoms, like
irregular hysteria, are engendered: they at
length convert, or at least aggravate, accelerate,
and multiply imaginary into real
evils, deranging the complicated offices of
digestion and circulation: hence flatulence,
eructation, indigestion, nausea, acid bilious
vomiting, exspuition of watery fluid, irregular
appetite; profuse, irregular excretions
and secretions by urine, perspiration,
saliva, mucus, diarrhœa, or its reverse costiveness;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">{231}</a></span>
with palpitation of the heart,
flushing of heat and cold, fugacious spasms,
anhelation; obscure vision, vertigo, noise
in the ears, headach, disturbed sleep, frightful
dreams; slothfulness, pusillanimity,
want of resolution and activity, disposition
to seriousness and sadness, shyness, suspicion,
peevishness, moroseness: the mind often dejected
and in despair, so as not to be solaced
with hopes of relief. It sometimes ceases,
or at least abates weeks and months, recurring
in periodical exacerbations on any exciting
cause or mental distress, intemperance,
or vicissitudes and irregularity of the seasons.
Costiveness and hardened feces indicate the
obstinacy of the disease. It is not immediately
dangerous to life; but when of inveterate
continuance, may terminate in insanity,
cachexy, jaundice, dropsy, tympany,
consumption.</p>

<p>The predisposing and occasional <i>causes</i> are
morbid extreme of sensibility; hereditary;
various depressing passions of mind; studious
sedentary life and abstruse meditation;
retirement to an inactive after a bustling
busy life; excess of venery, manustupration;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">{232}</a></span>
wealth, indolence, transient, unsatisfactory
amusements; revelling in pleasures,
and cloyed with satiety; November
fogs, easterly winds, sirocco winds; intemperance
in food or drink, suppression of
usual and solitary evacuations, as menses,
hemorrhoids; repulsion of cutaneous eruptions;
obstruction in the circulation through
the vena porta and liver, and in the biliary
secretion; obstruction in the abdominal viscera;
debility in the stomach and intestines,
and consequently vitiated chyle; pituita
in excess; worms; irregular gout;
hystericks; intermittent fever.</p>

<h3 class="header"><i>Insanity</i>,</h3> <p class="header">lunacy, mania, melancholia, and
complex insanity. During the preceding
century, distracted and lunatick was the
term in the London registers; and in the
last thirty years of that century, amounted
in the funerals to 544; but in the present
century, are quadruple. We must reflect,
that two of the largest lunatick hospitals in
Europe are erected in this metropolis, exclusive
of several large private madhouses;
all of which are of late years enlarged and
multiplied in London and its suburbs. Into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">{233}</a></span>
these publick and private receptacles many
lunaticks, from sundry parts of the kingdom,
are congregated; amounting in all, by the
nearest calculation which I can form, to upwards
of one thousand. Perhaps those whom
nature originally, or disease branded as idiots,
are also included in the lunatick catalogue
of mortality. The coroner’s inquest
generally returns suicides as lunaticks, after
reciting the mode of their death; but the
searcher’s reports in the bills of mortality,
have invariably ranged lunatick and self-murder
under two distinct heads. I have
reason to believe that many lunatick deaths
in London are not reported, from their being
interred in dissenting and unregistered burying
grounds, or in other places of interment
without the verge of the bills; others
intentionally suppressed, and a considerable
remnant sunk amongst the suicides and drowned.
It is probable, that in lunaticks and suicides,
this island may challenge any other in
Europe, whether in modern or in ancient
times.</p>

<p>In illustrating this disease, above all others
so little understood by the community, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">{234}</a></span>
the medical profession, or, in truth, by the
greatest part of the authors on the subject, I
shall rather trespass beyond the limits of a
concise systematic survey of diseases. I had
long since procured the printed annual reports
of Bedlam during thirty years, from
1750 to 1780, wherein it appeared, that out
of 6000 lunaticks, the deaths amounted to
1200, or 1 of 5. This information, so far as
it went, was partly truth, but it was not the
whole truth; and, in confirmation of the
general proverb, I was compelled to search
for it in a well. I was anxious to extend
my inquiries to a vast variety of particulars,
not one of which could be learned from the
crowd of authors, good, bad, and indifferent,
whom I perused for this purpose; from the
remote era of the Greek and Roman Catholicon,
the Hellebore, down to the present
time.</p>

<p>Chagrined with this unprofitable research,
I waited upon the learned and venerable
physician of Bedlam, Dr. Monro; who, with
his accustomed liberality and affability, recommended
me to his son, upon whom the
principal medical department of Bedlam now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">{235}</a></span>
devolves; and in whom the hereditary virtue
and exalted medical reputation of the
father, are not likely to suffer any diminution.
Dr. Monro, junior, introduced me to
Mr. Gonza, the apothecary of Bedlam;
whose curiosity and learning induced him to
keep a private register of all the patients;
and with all which Mr. Gonza most obligingly
furnished me. It is from the records
of this respectable and well-informed gentleman,
especially on the subject of insanity,
that I am enabled to form all the following
Tables and data respecting a disease, wherein,
except to the few high-priests of those
temples, the rest of the Esculapian train are
nearly as ignorant as the ancients; and the
unenlightened mass of the community stare
with superstitious amazement as the Israelites
formerly on the epilepsy.</p>

<p>In penetrating this untrodden wilderness,
and reconnoitering an unexplored host of
morbid foes, I shall proceed with the cautious
investigation of astronomers and natural
philosophers; first to establish the facts
and phenomena previous to any deduction or
inference. From Bedlam, the largest palace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">{236}</a></span>
and congregation of insane in any part of the
globe; and from its valuable, but hitherto
dormant archives, I shall attempt to settle all
the leading and important data, by analyzing
its internal history and transactions during
fifteen years, or half a generation; which is
sufficient to decide every ambiguity nearly as
well as half a century. The materials are
extracted from many volumes; they are condensed,
classed, and arranged into a concise
compendium, with no little trouble and fatigue
to the author. In number, and consequently
in magnitude of information, they
must be as superior to any solitary individual
observations on this subject, as the swelling
flood of the Thames is to one of the thousand
smaller rills which are swallowed up in
its majestic stream. In this way we shall not
be confounded with contradictory affirmation
and negation, and the clash of oracles.</p>

<p>The following, therefore, are the general
proportions which I shall endeavour to demonstrate,
and upon them to found a multitude
of others: the comparative proportion
of insane males and females; their ages; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">{237}</a></span>
cured; incurable, and dead; the length of
time they were insane before admission; the
mischievous; those who attempted suicide;
and the harmless; the relapses; the periods
when recovery may be despaired of; the various
remote causes. Mr. Gonza had distinguished
the married and single; but in a
treatise of this nature, these, and many other
minutiæ, must be omitted.</p>

<p>The usual number, on a general average,
of patients in Bedlam is 250; of which 110
are stationary incurables, male and female;
and who remain there until they either die,
or are discharged, for reasons hereafter to be
explained. The remainder are a moving
body, upwards of 200 of whom are annually
admitted, and the same number annually
discharged: the difference of males and females
is very inconsiderable; in general the
latter rather preponderate. During fifteen
years, from 1772 to 1787, of 2829 insane
males and females, their respective ages and
numbers in each interval of life, when
classed, were as follows:—Under 10 years
of age, 1; from 10 to 20, 132; from
20 to 30, 813; from 30 to 40, 908; from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">{238}</a></span>
40 to 50, 632; from 50 to 60, 266; from
60 and upwards, 78. Of these the cured
were, 934; the incurable, 1694; the dead,
230. Of these also, the mischievous were
743; attempted suicide, 323; not mischievous,
886; committed shocking murders,
upwards of 20; relapsed, 535.</p>

<p>It seems necessary to be first mentioned,
that I made memorandums of all the different
periods, and time elapsed, from the
invasion of the disease, or insane paroxism,
to their admission into Bedlam, from one
week to one year and upwards. I do not,
however, think it important to form a distinct
class, or table, of these, but merely to
observe in the aggregate, that of the patients
admitted into Bedlam, the majority were not
above six months unremittingly deprived of
reason; and those, in all the intervals, from
one week to six months. The second great
class were, in the intervals, from six to twelve
months. After one year, and upwards, there
are comparatively very few admissions, except
on the incurable list.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">{239}</a></span></p>

<p>The ages at which insanity predominates
are obvious, and require no comment. During
the first period under 20, the greatest
part of this small group were between 15
and 20. The ages of about 300, as also of
their cures, incurables, and deaths, are omitted
in the records: fractional exactness cannot be
expected: but for gross calculation there is
abundant accuracy. With respect to the
cured, incurable, and dead, I shall make a
few remarks: amongst the discharged I
found a considerable number reported as sick
and weak; others, and amounting to some
hundreds, as troubled with fits, or with paralytick
strokes, and some with a complication
of both the latter maladies; and also a small
fragment of pregnant females; and none of
these liberated from insanity. All these I
threw into the incurable list, as I could discover
very few of them ever to return back again.
Many of the sick and weak may safely be
added to the dead list; being on the confines
of the grave when dismissed. The incurables
likewise contain those admitted on the incurable
list of Bedlam, as well as the great
mass discharged from thence incurable, after
one year’s trial.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">{240}</a></span></p>

<p>About one of every three are reported as
cured; but from them we must subtract for
relapses, which probably would sink the cured,
radically, to one of 4. The cured are reported
in all the intervals, from one month to one
year. Formerly the mortality in Bedlam
was swelled by adventitious diseases, particularly
the small pox and scurvy; both of
which are now prevented. Melancholy and
confinement are known to predispose to
scurvy, but by an increase of vegetable diet,
this disease is no longer in the mortal catalogue
of Bedlam. The mental derangement,
no doubt, must add to the mortality: numbers
discharged, as troubled with epilepsy
and palsy, must have fallen into these afflictions
posterior to their admission, as they
are always an exception: and it is observed,
that few are cured without the fits also. The
insane generally die of epileptick, apoplectick,
and paralytick strokes, and convulsions, of
frenzy, atrophy, or nervous tabes. If we were
to add the sick and weak, the fits and palsy, I
believe lunatick mortality would be doubled;
and would then be about one of five or six.
More comparatively die of the insane patients<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">{241}</a></span>
recently admitted, than of the stationary incurables.</p>

<p>The greatest proportion of patients in Bedlam,
especially at the beginning, have attempted
some mischief against themselves, or
their relations and keepers: in the above list
there are above a score of atrocious murderers,
exclusive of suicides. There are parricides,
and butchers of their own offspring.
Their mischievous acts and attempts were in
various ways, by jumping out of windows,
hanging, drowning, stabbing, shooting, tearing
off their cloaths, setting fire to houses,
and several other overt acts of malignity.
Some were mischievous by open acts of violence;
others by threats only. Some not
mischievous at first, have become so, and
“<i>vice versa</i>;” and several reported as not
mischievous, have afterwards hanged themselves.
Females, as well as males, are mischievous;
but I do not observe so many dreadful
murders committed by the female sex.
By far the greater majority of patients in
Bedlam, except at temporary intervals and
exacerbations, walk peaceably about the
wards: separate confinement in their cells,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">{242}</a></span>
strait waistcoats, or in the ferocious maniac,
handcuffs and chains, soon render them tractable
and obedient: a very small number,
even of incurables, are kept as wild beasts,
constantly in fetters. Some, by time and
long confinement in the incurables, and who
were extremely vicious and dangerous, become
harmless, and are then discharged.
From all the variety of causes, depressing or
stimulating, I perceive mischievous or harmless.
This circumstance seems to make no
material difference in the curable or incurable.
Numbers who had attempted suicide,
some who had committed murders, are in
the list of cured.</p>

<p>I also perceive recoveries after reiterated relapses;
and the prognosticks are then nearly
as favourable as though it had been the first
attack. No disease is more prone to relapse:
these are, at various intervals, in different
persons, from one to upwards of twenty
years, and during this period, either one
or many relapses. Multitudes of the relapses
are either after being discharged cured from
Bedlam, or before they were brought there
for admission. There are some few instances,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">{243}</a></span>
wherein the sagacious physician of Bedlam
has been deceived; and when, after apparent
recovery, and the subsequent lunatick quarantine,
patients have been discharged with
sound bills of health, but on the same day
have relapsed; and even before departure
from the house. They are in danger of relapses
from all the causes which give birth to
insanity. From the proportion of cured and
incurable, and successive relapses, many of
which at length become incurable, we see how
difficult it is, as yet, to expel this mental
usurper, and to restore chaos into order.</p>

<p>I do not observe so great a difference in
the recovery, from either age or cause, as
might be expected: there are cured and incurable,
promiscuously at all ages; and from
all the different causes, whether adventitious
or hereditary. Even from hereditary insanity,
they seem to recover nearly as well as
from the less inherent causes: there are several
instances of recovery when hereditary
from the parents on both sides. In some,
where the disease was entailed, it has
made its first appearance in all the intervals
from puberty to fifty years of age. I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">{244}</a></span>
struck with one curious instance of hereditary
insanity from both parents, in a brother and
sister, and nearly about the same time; the
one twenty, the other twenty-three years of
age; one of whom was melancholic, the
other maniac. There are some few instances
of recovery after one, two, or even three
years pertinacious privation of reason: some
few of the incurable in Bedlam have recovered;
but all these are very rare. After
only one year’s uninterrupted perseverance
of the disease, they are generally refused admission
into Bedlam, except as incurables;
and of such I cannot perceive the cured above
one or two <i>per cent.</i></p>

<p>Many features and particulars of the insane
character and history have now been
developed. But I have not yet, as in other
diseases, ventured to affix a nosological signature,
or definition, and to circumscribe the
limits between the insane and the multitude
of others reputed as rational beings. In such
an attempt I might probably appear as ridiculous
as the Greek philosopher in his concise
definition of man. It is not confined within
the porticoes of Bedlam and madhouses:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">{245}</a></span>
we might find it sprinkled over the earth;
not only amongst the fanaticks of Asia, the
Bonzes and Faquirs, and some of the austere
cloistered devotees of Europe; but thro’
every rank and station of civilized communities.</p>

<p>Insanity has been usually described in the
two extremes of mania, and melancholia:
but it is frequently of a complex nature,
with alternating exacerbations of frenzy, and
of melancholy. It is termed a delirium
without fever; of which mental anarchy
there are innumerable symptoms, gradations,
shades, species, and varieties: the enumeration
of which would be as infinite as the
diversity of their faces and ideas. Sometimes
insanity bursts out unexpectedly, like
a squall of wind or thunder-storm: but in
general the paroxism is preceded days,
weeks, or even months, by few or many of
the following symptoms, which vary in different
persons; quick motion of the eyelids,
redness or wildness in the eyes and
looks, restlessness, headach, vertigo, by something
unusual and different from their ordinary
conduct in the speech, gestures, actions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">{246}</a></span>
looks; by high or low spirits, loquacity, or
taciturnity: in some, the appetite is voracious;
in others, there is aversion to food.</p>

<p>On the first ebullition of frantick mania,
the looks, voice, and gestures are wild and
impetuous; in many audacious and ferocious:
they are irascible, impatient, and violent on
any contradiction or restraint: they ramble
with wonderful rapidity of ideas, and garrulity
of speech, from one object to another;
shouting, singing, laughing: some, transported
with extacy, roam in incoherent rhapsody
through all the fairy regions of enchantment
and romance: we observe maniacks
in idea personating every being and
object celestial and terrestrial, animate and
inanimate.  But by such numbers either
attempting or committing mischief upon
themselves or others, it is evident that the
disagreeable, turbulent, malevolent, and desponding
passions do often predominate;
there is more of the jarring and discordant
than of the harmonick notes and keys: some
maniacks are distracted with malevolence,
antipathy, animosity, rancour, and revenge.
In the melancholia, the mind is generally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">{247}</a></span>
rivetted upon one object and train of thought,
about which they incessantly rave or ponder:
many are cogitative, taciturn, morose,
or fixed like statues: and more of this character
are said to commit suicide. Some,
plunged into despair, are haunted with all
the horrors of tartarus; or even chained
within the gloomy dungeons and inexorable
bars of Cerberus.</p>

<p>In mania the strength is prodigiously
increased. In general, insane persons endure
hunger, cold, nakedness, want of sleep,
with astonishing perseverance and impunity.
During the exacerbation, most are restless;
and most are costive. Some obstinately
refuse all food and medicine, and are
drenched by compulsion, as horses taking
physick; which at length renders them
more docile. Some, if indulged, are ravenous
and insatiable as wolves. Some melancholick,
on relapses, have only a periodical
invasion of profound grief, want of sleep
and appetite, restlessness and anxiety. Many
persons, universally considered as insane, will
however, at times, act, speak, converse, and
reason acutely on various subjects, until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">{248}</a></span>
some particular mental string or chord is
touched.  With respect to general prognosticks
in insanity, we have been already copious
and diffuse; and shall only add, that
in some degree of mania, more favourable
hopes are entertained than in gloomy melancholy:
indecency, no intermissions or remissions,
epilepsy, palsy, tabes, frenzy, are all
inauspicious. The piercing and intuitive eye
of the experienced physiognomist, will also
discern presages which are concealed from
ordinary comprehension and observation.</p>

<p>Of the predisposing and occasional <i>causes</i>
of insanity. We all know by demonstration
and reading, that one eighth part of
the blood is circulated through the head:
we know the origin and distribution of its
spinal elongation, and forty pairs of nerves;
its internal structure to the most minute discernible
filaments; its division into cavities
and prominences, many of them with uncouth
names, and swelling the nauseous vocabulary
of anatomy. But still the latent predisposition
or frailty in the recesses of the
brain, which render some more than others
liable to this mutiny of reason, on the application<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">{249}</a></span>
of remote and obvious causes, are
totally unknown.  Most of the proximate
causes assigned in authors for madness, are
mere hypotheses; and of no active use to the
community, or to medicine.  The pretended
discoveries of the anatomical knife; and
the specific gravity or levity of the brain
in scales, are equally conjectural. The great
master, decypherer, and physiologist of the
intellectual functions, Mr. Locke, has here
taught us to despair, and to be convinced of
the imperfection of our senses and faculties.
Literature, however, ancient and modern,
abounds with madmen and authors, especially
on the intellectual operations, and
springs of sense and motion. Many other
subjects yet remain to engage our attention,
and to prevent our digressing into the jaded
topick of temperaments; of original organization;
or the progressive revolutions, corporeal
and mental, by age and time. This
is an inexhaustible theme for observation and
lucubration.</p>

<p>The late Dr. Mead broached a proposition,
which has been transfused through most
succeeding authors: that from sudden transports<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">{250}</a></span>
of joy, and the exhilirating passions,
more were insane than from contrary causes:
and he quotes Bedlam as an instance during
the year of the South-Sea scheme, when great
fortunes were suddenly acquired and lost.
I took the trouble, so far as they are recorded,
to class the different causes of insanity;
which contain nearly one third of
the whole patients during the fifteen years
of our scrutiny; wherein I do not find a
single example in proof of Dr. Mead’s aphorism,
but hundreds in direct contradiction
to it; as appears in the following table of
causes:—Misfortunes, troubles, disappointments,
grief, 206; religion and Methodism,
90; love, 74; jealousy, 6; fright, 51;
study, 15; pride, 8; drink and intoxication,
58; fever, 110; parturition, 79; obstruction,
10; family and hereditary, 115;
contusion and fracture, 12; venereal, 14;
small pox, 7; ulcers and scab dried up, 5.—I
have not time to comment upon these causes:
to them may be added all the train of exasperating
passions; long attention of mind
rivetted upon one object; faults of the blood
or bile, and circulation in the vena porta;
plethora in the vessels of the head; <i>furor uterin</i>;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">{251}</a></span>
in some of the Asiatic nations, opium;
also intoxicating poisons snuffed by the nose;
“<i>cum multis aliis</i>.” The revolution of the
seasons seem to have no effect on insanity;

vision, hearing, smell, taste; to
these we shall add the diseases of the voice and
speech; obstructed deglutition; sterility, and
morbid irritability of the generative organs.
The derangement of those delicate and precious
senses through which we derive such
supreme delight; through whose avenues are
conveyed into man the first rudiments of all
his variegated ideas and knowledge, are important
objects of medical scrutiny; notwithstanding
very few from these causes are
precipitated into the crater of mortality. I
could, however, have wished to ascertain
from registers, in conformity with my general
plan, the proportion of cured and incurable;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">{252}</a></span>
and especially the average of blind in
a community.</p>

<div class="force_p"><h3 class="header"><i>Vision.</i></h3> <p class="header">The principal diseases may be
comprehended under opthalmia, fistula-lachrymalis,
gutta-serena, cataract, specks on
the cornea. I exclude some other natural
defects, rather than diseases, such as myops,
presbyops; for the cure of which the optician
is the best physician.</p>

<p>Opthalmy, or inflammation of the eyes is
a frequent complaint: it may be in the exterior
membranes of the globe, or in the
edges of the eye-lids; or may be a complication
of both; it may be in one, or in both
eyes; it may be general, partial, external,
internal, temporary, chronic, idiopathick,
symptomatick: of all which species there
are various gradations. In this local malady
there is commonly little or no fever;
but heat, pain, redness, and inflammation;
the vessels of the eyes seem gorged with
blood; the anterior portion of the tunica sclerotica,
and the conjunctiva, resemble a scarlet
cloth, with impediment in vision, intolerance
of light, lachrymation. In the inflammation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">{253}</a></span>
of the cartilaginous ring of the
eye-lids or tarsus, there is frequently some
remains of small ulcerations in the sebaceous
glands. The external is by far the most
frequent form of opthalmy; and, under discreet
management, is attended with trifling
danger: sometimes, however, it is followed
by specks on the cornea, or callosity, and
blindness; and violent inflammation has extended
to the interior parts of the eyes and
retina. In the internal inflammation of the
choroid and retina, no redness is perceptible
externally; but there is excruciating pain,
headach, intolerance of light, restlessness, often
delirium, in a few instances, insanity:
and if not relieved in the course of fourteen
days, there is danger of incurable blindness.</p>

<p>Fistula lachrymalis. In this partial inflammation
affecting the lachrymal sac and ducts,
and obstructing the descent of the tears, or
superfluous moisture of the eyes into the
nose, this fluid necessarily trickles down the
cheeks, and the eye is overflowed with water:
on pressure of the internal angle and
puncta lachrymalia, there is a discharge of
glareous serum, by which the eye-lids, during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">{254}</a></span>
sleep, are glewed together. The degrees
of inflammation and obstruction are
various. In the inveterate stages it may terminate
in abscess, ulcers, and caries of the
contiguous nasal bone.</p>

<p>Gutta-serena, amaurosis; in one or in both
eyes, and in various gradations, from obscure
vision to cheerless tenebrosity. To a spectator
the eyes appear nearly as in health, only
that the pupil is dilated and inanimate; the
retina insensible to the rays of light, and the
iris mute, without corresponding contraction
or enlargement: a physiognomist might say,
there are no sensitive emanations or magnetick
rays emitted through this mental mirror. It
attacks suddenly or gradually, and sometimes
intermits; but in general it is chronic, and
always dangerous; often irremediable: sometimes
it is accompanied with headach in the
anterior part over the eye-brows.</p>

<p>Cataract may affect one eye, but in general
both: it arises from disease or opacity of the
crystalline lens obstructing the visual rays in
their course to the retina: the consistence
and colour of the lens is various, white,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">{255}</a></span>
pearl, green, yellow; and from these the
oculist forms his prognostick: in couching
the eye the pearl-coloured is preferred: the
white is too soft; the green and yellow incurable;
as is also that species wherein the
strongest rays of light excite no contraction
of the pupil. Cataracts in general are gradual
in their formation; weeks, months.</p>

<p>The predisposing and occasional <i>causes</i> of
injured vision and of opthalmy, external violence
and blows; sudden suppression of
perspiration; extraneous bodies or acrids admitted
within the eye-lids; acrid metallic
fumes, and noxious exhalations; long exposure
to confined smoke, especially from wood
fires; smoky houses and cottages; acrid
collyria; epidemick state of the air, and infection;
long continuance of wet weather;
long exposure of the eyes to the rays of
strong light, to snow, or luminous objects;
cold streams of air; suppression of salutary
evacuations, or cutaneous eruptions, and of
chronic ulcers; acrimony of the blood; interruption
to the free return of blood from
the head; frequent intoxication: nocturnal
studies; long want of sleep, grief, tears; small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">{256}</a></span>
tubercles within the eye-lids; ulcerated eye-lids;
variolous: morbillous; scrophulous;
venereal; erysipelatous; rheumatick; catarrhal;
intermittent; herpes; cancerous.
Of fistula-lachrymalis, inflammation of the
lachrymal sac, or ducts.  Of gutta-serena,
plethora, distention of the vessels of the retina;
palsy of the optick nerves, general or
partial; diseases of the brain, or of the retina;
profuse and suppressed evacuations;
excess of venery; chronic headach; ebriety;
cachexy; venereal; intermittent; symptomatick
in the irregular gout, apoplexy, &amp;c.
Of the cataract, opacity of the crystalline
lens. The general causes of injured vision,
exclusive of opthalmy, may be briefly enumerated;
and are long attention to minute
objects; weakness of the power to contract
the pupil; faults of the globe; defect of
the aqueous humour, its impurity or density;
opacity of the lens, or of the vitreous humour;
the retina callous or too sensible;
faults of the optic nerves; contraction, concretion,
flaccidity of the pupil; gibbous or
convex lens, or too near and flat; dropsical
eye; spasm, or palsy of the ocular muscles;
diseases and ulcerations of the eye-lids and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">{257}</a></span>
ciliary glands; ulcers and fistula, specks and
scars, in the cornea; films growing from the
angle of the eye; the eye-lids inverted, elongated,
concreted; various diseases of the brain
from internal or external causes.</p></div>

may be included hoarse, guttural, stridulous,

stammering, lisping, defect and impediments
in articulation, muteness. The <i>causes</i>,
defect or waste of mucus by exertion of the

exercising that important and divine function
of giving creation to their own species. The
<i>causes</i> in the male sex are, palsy, or torpidity
of the penis, or its nerves, or generative organs;
the penis short, monstrous in size, its
prepuce straitned; impediments in the urethra
and seminal ducts; testicles, epididymidis,
vasa deferentia; the semen inert, vapid, aqueous,
scanty; weakness of the ejecting or accelerator

tabes.  In our climate the uterine mania
rarely occurs in that extreme of indecency
described by authors.  The woman at first
is bashful and silent; the pulse and circulation
are agitated on mentioning a venereal
topick; by significant looks and gestures she
betrays her passion; and if disappointed, becomes
low-spirited, anxious, and wastes in
flesh.  The same has happened to some
women who had the mortification to be
linked with impotent husbands. Sometimes,
however, this universal passion has burst into
a flame; the woman losing all sense of
shame, soliciting, with obscenity in speech
and gestures, the embraces of the other
sex; and raving on this theme with maniacal
insanity.  The <i>causes</i>, acrid serum,
spasm, inflammation of the urethra, vagina,
or other generative organs; irritation of
the bladder, womb, rectum; obstructed
menses; fluor albus, heat, excoriation of the

<h3 class="faux" title="Impediments in deglutition and manducation"></h3>

<p><i>Deglutition</i> interrupted: we very rarely
meet with this similitude of tantalus, wherein
food or drink is either swallowed with difficulty
and pain, or totally interrupted in its
descent to the stomach, and regurgitated by
the mouth or nose. The causes spasmodick
constriction of the œsophagus, and in various
parts of the tube; palsy of the muscles
of deglutition; tumors or scirrhus in
the pharynx, œsophagus, pylorus, trachea,
thyroid or dorsal glands; aneurism and enlargement
of the aorta, ulcers in the œsophagus;
luxation of the os hyoides; compression
of the pharyngeal nerves; cachexy,
worms, crudity, passions, extraneous substances
stuck in the throat. The spasmodick
is periodical and painful; and also affects the
voice: in the lower part of the œsophagus it
excites pain between the shoulders; sometimes
eructation and vomiting.</p>

<p><i>Manducation.</i> Diseases of the teeth are the
principal impediments to the exercise of this

<h2 class="header"><a name="Diseases_of_the_Stomach_and_Intestinal" id="Diseases_of_the_Stomach_and_Intestinal"></a><i><span class="first-word">Diseases</span> of the Stomach and Intestinal
Tube</i>,</h2> <p class="header">are very universal and frequent
maladies in both sexes, and throughout all
orders and ages. The stomach and alimentary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">{264}</a></span>
canal are furnished with numerous
nerves; and the sensibility of the former very
acute, especially at its upper extremity. The
length of the human alimentary tube, from
the mouth to the anus, is five or six times
the length of the whole body: it is folded
into many convolutions, as may be daily
seen at shambles, on the opening of animals.
Into this alimentary muscular and contractile
sewer are incessantly heaped food and
drink, besides a variety of copious secretions
from the body, requisite in the process of
digestion and assimilation of chyle, as saliva,
pancreatick fluid, bile, mucus, and arterial
exhalation from the whole of its internal surface.</p>

<p>Within the short space of a few weeks,
the generality of mankind consume more
food and drink than amounts to the whole
weight of their bodies. This diurnal superfluity
and load, together with the corrupted
and abraded animal parts of the body,
and the different secreted fluids, must again,
in a few hours, be expelled through the principal
human excretories; the fecal, urinary,
perspiratory. In the healthy state, by far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">{265}</a></span>
the smallest proportion of this diurnal superfluity
is through the intestinal excretion: the
greatest part is absorbed by the lacteals and
lymphaticks, intermixed with the blood,
and afterwards filtered by urine, perspiration,
and in the puerperal state, milk. In
cold climates and winters, especially if moist,
the urine; in warm climates, the perspiration
preponderates. But in these prodigious diversities
ensue from exercise or rest, sleep
and waking, passions of mind, the quantity
or quality of food, cleanness of the skin, constitution,
atmosphere, and the alternation
with each other of these excretions. Again,
when we reflect that from the small parotid
glands, between a pint and a quart of saliva
is secerned during the twenty-four hours; and
on the prodigious secretion through the kidneys,
we may easily conceive in the natural
and morbid state, what a considerable
quantity may be secerned from the liver,
the largest of the abdominal viscera: making,
however, some deduction for the slower
circulation through the vena porta.</p>

<p>The chart of London diseases demand
some criticism on that inextricable miscellany<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">{266}</a></span>
surfeits, stoppage of the stomach, vomiting,
cholick and gripes, bloody flux. In
the last century, surfeits make a monstrous
article in the chronicle of deaths, amounting
in some years to four hundred; whereas,
during fifteen years of the present century,
they sink down to only fifteen. Yet all
are witnesses that good eating and gormandizing
are not worn out of fashion in this
metropolis. Medical men know that surfeits
and intemperance are often merely predisposing
or occasional causes of diseases: they
may rouse latent disorders, or dispose the
body to receive noxious impressions externally.
The searches therefore formerly, as
I suspect, made many of these reports from
the ostensible cause which they imagined
gave birth to the disease and mortality. At
the same time, I am not contending for the
delicacy and moderation of our forefathers
appetites. They were unquestionably in the
last century, and partly indeed from the
cheapness of flesh-meat, and scarcity of vegetable
nutriment, more carnivorous in their
diet than the present generation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">{267}</a></span></p>

<p>Stoppage of the stomach also, is a morbid
centaur in the last century. It would baffle
the ingenuity of an antiquarian to decypher
the true import of this term: severe sickness,
or the word Abracadabra, would be full
as intelligible. It is a vulgar name for rejection
of food; and there are few diseases
in which the stomach does not sympathize.
What proportion of the mortality of infants,
adults, or the sexes, are crammed into this
absurd article, I submit to the reader’s criticism.</p>

<p>An important circumstance, and overlooked
so far as I know, by all the calculators and
criticks on the rise and fall of infant diseases
in London, and especially of convulsions, is
this. In the first column of 15 years, at the
beginning of the present century, colick and
gripes of the guts amount to 13668, but
continue through every succeeding column
to diminish; and in the last or fifth, dwindle
to 769 only. What is meant by this complaint,
colick and gripes? was it dysentery?
We observe that bloody flux makes a separate,
though small group, through all the
five columns. Were these two diseases confounded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">{268}</a></span>
in the annual reports? or may it
not be alledged, that many infant diseases
and deaths, which were formerly crowded
into colick and gripes, are in modern times
transferred to the vortex of convulsions? I
am aware that, in reply, it may be suggested
that drains, sewers, drier lodgings, less damp,
alteration in diet, and the more plentiful use
of vegetable and fermented liquors, have decreased
dysenteric complaints in this city;
and also, that Dr. Sydenham, in 1670 and 71,
describes an autumnal dysentery as annually
prevailing in London, and about two months
in duration. Turning the subject into every
possible view, I continue to suspect that numbers
of infant diseases, and commonly terminating
fatally in convulsions, were formerly
heaped into gripes and colick; for during
the last thirty years of the preceding century,
they amount to the enormous number of
69,799.</p>

<h3 class="header"><i>Diseases of the Stomach</i></h3> <p class="header">are idiopathick and
symptomatick. Under the present head we
shall include inappetency, indigestion, nausea,
vomiting, eructation, acidity, cardialgy,
heartburn, regurgitation of bile, pica, soda,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">{269}</a></span>
pyrosis, hiccup, rumination. Several of these
are obvious symptoms, and are often complicated.
Inappetency is generally accompanied
with nausea. Foulness or feculence in
the stomach, is indicated by weight and load
in that region, anxiety, nausea, eructation,
disagreeable taste in the mouth, foul tongue:
the state of the gustatory organ is some index
to that of the stomach. Acidity in excess
will excite eructation, flatulence, heartburn,
gnawing pain in that part, irregular appetite
and craving, colicks, gripes, diarrhœa, vomiting.
In infants, acidity is very frequently
predominant; hence acid eructation,
restlessness, gripes, green curdled feces, tumor
of the abdomen, dyspnœa, sometimes
costiveness, or diarrhœa, and sometimes dry
cough, and muscular paleness and flaccidity.
Of bilious regurgitation there are various gradations:
with severe sickness at the stomach,
nausea, bilious vomiting, bitter taste on the
tongue, and its surface furred; inappetency,
frequently colick; sometimes temporary jaundice.
The cardialgy is a severe pain, threatening
syncope. The pica an aversion to natural
aliment, and craving for unusual. The
bulimy is a monstrous appetency for food.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">{270}</a></span>
The heartburn denotes a sensation of uneasiness,
heat, and acrimony: the soda, or water-brash,
a burning heat in the stomach and
fauces, anxiety, acid eructation, exspuition
of lymph, and fretting the edge of the
teeth.</p>

<p>The pyrosis, or cardialgia-sputatoria, is
more frequent and endemic in some countries
than others; and, it is alledged, more amongst
the poor than affluent, and amongst females
than males; and of the former, the single and
barren: it rarely occurs in puberty, or in
old age. The pain at the stomach and back
is often very severe, and with anxiety, until
the torrent of watery fluid bursts forth,
which, after continuing one or two days,
intermits: but relapses are frequent, and
the disease is contumacious. The hiccup,
or sudden convulsive inspiration, is a complicated
affliction of the stomach and diaphragm.
Of rumination in the human species,
there is scarce an instance in a generation.</p>

<p>The predisposing and occasional <i>causes</i> of
the preceding diseases of the stomach are in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">{271}</a></span>
general, weakness of the muscular coats;
diseases of its nerves; small omentum; the
digestive menstrua as bile, saliva, mucus, defective
or depraved; frequent exspuition and
waste of saliva; slow digestion, and food corrupted
in the stomach; crudities in the stomach;
vitiated chyle; excess of pituita,
acidity, bile; relaxed pylorus, large stomach,
calculi in the biliary ducts; scirrhus stomach,
pancreas, liver, spleen, duodenum; mucus of
the stomach abraded; ulcers, cancer, depression
of the xiphoid cartilage; frequent emeticks
and purgatives; valetudinarian regimen,
too much physick, quackery, and care about
health; gluttony, epicurism, pampered indulgence
of that passion and appetite; frequent
surfeits; dram-drinking; malt liquors
in excess; the aliment in quantity or quality,
or in multiplicity at one meal, injurious;
ravenous ingurgitation at meals, and imperfect
manducation; fat, rancid, corrupted,
salted, and indigestible farinaceous food; tea,
tobacco, watery liquids: in infancy, acid
milk, sucking to excess, curdled milk in the
stomach; superfluous acid generated in the
stomach; too violent agitation in the nurse’s
arms; passions of the nurse; too tight bandages;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">{272}</a></span>
saliva swallowed in excess during dentition;
too much vegetable diet and milk:
to the catalogue of general causes may be
added various depressing and cankering passions
of mind; cares and troubles; want of
sleep, intemperate study, sedentary life, unremitting
application to sedentary business;
moist cold air, foul air of cities; leaning forward
on the stomach, and improper postures
of the body; costiveness; suppression
of salutary evacuations and cutaneous
exanthemata; sanguineous plethora; conference
of hereditary infirmity, bad health,
old age, chlorosis, worms, gout, rheumatism,
intermittent and remittent fevers, and
of various other acute and chronic diseases;
poisons; extraneous substances swallowed,
contusions on the head; external injuries;
blows and falls.</p>

<h3 class="header"><i>Cholera Morbus</i></h3> <p class="header">is much more frequent in
tropical and warm climates; and in northern
regions in the summer and autumnal seasons;
especially in unusually hot summers. The
disease is not unfrequent in this island and
metropolis; nor is it entirely restricted to
the warm season only. The symptoms are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">{273}</a></span>
sickness and nausea, succeeded by violent vomiting
and purging, of a bilious nature, with
gripes, tenesmus, tension of the abdomen,
anxiety, great prostration of strength, intense
thirst, cardialgy, and sometimes muscular
spasms in the lower extremities. The vomiting
and purging either commence about the
same time, or alternate with each other: and
throughout its rapid race there is seldom any
fever. It is often a salutary effort of nature, by
which a superfluity of bile is disembogued; and
in cases of ordinary violence, may continue
a day or two, and then cease. In more tremendous
assaults it sometimes proves fatal
in twenty-four hours; portentous omens
of which are violent vomiting and purging,
sudden prostration of strength, quick weak
pulse, hiccup, fainting, cold sweats and extremities.
The predisposing and occasional
<i>causes</i> are, hot climate and seasons; in
warm climates extreme heat and dry weather,
succeeded by a fall of rain and coolness
of the atmosphere; sudden changes of weather;
increased secretion of bile and corrupted
bile; surfeits, intemperance, accumulation

<div class="force_p"><h3 class="header"><i>Dysentery</i>,</h3> <p class="header">bloody flux, spurious remittent.
This contagious disease has been before mentioned,
under remitting and autumnal fevers.
It is called by the sagacious Morton, the Spurious
Remittent turned on the intestines;
and by Sydenham also, who, perhaps undeservedly,
is panegyrized as a superior oracle,
the Fever of the Season turned on the
bowels.  The general symptoms are, frequent
stools with severe colick, gripes, and
tenesmus, or urgency to exonerate the intestines:
these evacuations are slimy, generally
with intermixture of blood, and fragments
of feces concreted into hard globules, and
unusually fetid.  It is also accompanied
with sickness at the stomach and pain, inappetency,
vomiting, flatulence, restlessness,
foul tongue, and more or less fever. When
fatal, many are destroyed between the seventh
and twentieth days; but when moderate, it
may be protracted much longer.  Relapses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">{275}</a></span>
are frequent on any irregularity or intemperance.
The <i>causes</i>, warm climates and
seasons, marshy effluvia; cold nights followed
by warm days; sudden suppression of
perspiration, especially in warm climates;
exposure to cold and moist air and rains, and
wet cloaths and beds; long continuance of
sultry and dry weather; excess and corruption
of bile; symptomatick; dysenterick
contagion from privies, beds, &amp;c.——<i>Vid.</i>

<div class="force_p"><h3 class="header"><i>Diarrhœa</i>,</h3> <p class="header">ventris profluvium; including
the different species, the celiaca, lienteria,
morbus hepaticus, niger, atrabilis. In the
simple diarrhœa, the evacuation by the anus
is unnaturally frequent and liquid. In the celiaca,
or chylous diarrhœa, the aliments and
chyle are ejected: and in the lienteria, like
a bucket whirling into a well, food is no
sooner taken than discharged. The morbus hepaticus
is without pain or tenesmus, with flux
of blood and serum, or like ink; in colour and
consistence various. Diarrhœa is accompanied
with gripes; but not so excruciating as in
the dysentery, with inappetency, dry skin,
thirst, hectic heat: but no considerable fever;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">{276}</a></span>
nor is it contagious. In the severity
and evacuation there are varieties: and in
some cases it is salutary. The <i>causes</i>, excess
of food and drink, or acrid putrescent aliment;
new fermented liquors; vegetable
laxative food; feculence in the intestines,
stercorous, pituitous; vitiated digestion, with
morbid irritability of the intestinal tube; irritability
of this muscular canal, and increase
of its peristaltic motion; atonia; excess and
acrimony of bile, warm climates, broken constitutions,
cachexy, chronic dysentery, immoderate
flux of humours to the intestinal
tube, and exhalation by the arterial extremities
of that canal; suppression of perspiration,
and of other evacuations; superfluity
of serous humours; impediments in
the absorption and passages of the chyle;
obstruction in the vena portarum; laxity of
the pylorus; palsy of the sphincter ani; ulcers
of the stomach, repelled gout, and rash;
sudden passions of mind; nervous irritation;
erosion or rupture of the blood-vessels on the
interior surface; obstruction of the spleen;
acrid dissolution of the blood; colliquative;
worms; symptomatic in fevers; purgatives;
poisons. In infancy, acidity, dentition, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">{277}</a></span>

of the nurse in diet; gravel in the kidneys.</p></div>

<div class="force_p"><h3 class="header"><i>Colick.</i></h3> <p class="header">From slight or serious attacks of
this torture, few of the community are exempted.
We here associate together the inflammatory,
spasmodic, saturnine, bilious, flatulent,
the infantile colick, and other species.
Colick is generally a temporary disease;
and with which some, much more
than others, are afflicted at intervals. Inflammation
of the intestines ileus, volvulus,
enteritis; generally sudden assault of excruciating,
fixed, and increasing pain, in some
degree affecting the whole abdomen, but
more pungent about the navel; with nausea,
frequent vomiting of food and drink, and
sometimes of intestinal feculence; obstinate
costiveness, severe gripes, eructation, flatulence:
the fever sometimes succeeding, sometimes
preceding, the local pain; and of which
there are exacerbations and remissions, and
various gradations. The pulse at the beginning
is not remarkably full nor frequent,
from which fatal mistakes and irremediable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">{278}</a></span>
procrastination, have often ensued in medical
practice: the urine is in small quantity,
or suppressed. It is much more frequent
in the narrow than the wide part of the intestinal
tube. In the rectum, constant tenesmus,
excretion of mucus; and in the male
sex strangury are natural consequences and
symptoms. Inflammation or nephritick paroxisms
in the kidneys and ureters, with
which it has been confounded, are hereafter
discriminated.</p>

<p>It is extremely dangerous and precipitate;
frequently destroying in a few days, sometimes
in one day, and is seldom protracted
beyond nine. There is less danger in
young than in old persons: abatement of
pain, cessation of nausea and vomiting, discharge
of flatulence and of feces, softer and
freer pulse, are favourable symptoms: unfavourable
are, unconquerable costiveness,
immoderate vomiting, tumid belly, eructation,
hiccup, cold extremities, gangrene; abscess
rarely. Inflammation is sometimes the
effect, and not the original cause of colick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">{279}</a></span></p>

<p>Under the spasmodick colick may be
classed the colica pictonum, saturnina, plumbeia,
and dry belly-ach of the West Indies.
The symptoms, writhing pain in the abdomen,
about the loins and back; retraction
of the navel towards the spine, dysury, ischury,
or strangury; costiveness with difficulty
removed, and the feces in conglobated
lumps, vomiting, anxiety, depression
of spirits. In the saturnine the countenance
is sometimes of a leaden colour, and there is a
saccharine taste on the tongue. This infests
various classes of artificers: sometimes terminating
in chronic colick, in palsy of the
lower extremities, and in convulsions.</p>

<p>Bilious colick is accompanied with severe
pain in the stomach and intestines, nausea,
sickness, vomiting of bile, costiveness, bitter
taste on the tongue, anxiety, dejection of
spirits, dysury, often flatulence. Its duration
is short, but it is prone to return on any
intemperance or irregularity; sometimes it
ends in jaundice. Flatulent colick is distinguished
by the pain being mobile, without
much nausea or vomiting, or hard pulse
and thirst, or fever; by considerable unusual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">{280}</a></span>
distention of the abdomen, and flatulent
explosion upwards and downwards; and
sometimes efforts to vomit until the flatulence
is ejected: respiration is also more or
less interrupted.</p>

<p>The infant colick is very frequent, and
infinitely more fatal in those years than the
London bills represent. Infants scream lamentably,
and cannot be appeased; they contract
and draw up their legs to the belly,
are restless, sometimes costive; but often
there is concomitant diarrhœa and green feces,
vomiting, flatulent explosion; and sometimes
the breath smells sour; in some the
urine is suppressed; and many die convulsed.</p>

<p>The predisposing and occasional <i>causes</i> of colick,
inflammatory, spasmodick, bilious, and
of most other species are, acrid matter of
aliment, medicines, poisons; acrid putrid
bile; obstruction of the intestinal tube by
indurated feculence, hair-balls, cherry-stones,
calculi, steatome, volvulus, intusesception,
contraction of the intestines in some part;
scirrhus, cancer, severe colick, spasm, ruptures;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">{281}</a></span>
wounds of the intestines; the aliments,
pickles, condiments, and luxuries of the
table, cooked, prepared, or preserved in lead
or copper vessels not well tinned; the lead
corroded from clayed vessels used for domestick
purposes; wine adulterated with
lead; cyder pressed in leaden cisterns; effluvia
of lead to which painters and some metallurgies
are exposed; excess or acrimony
of bile; broken constitutions in tropical climates;
acrid chyle; particular food or
drink; new fermented liquors; sudden
suppression of perspiration; cold wet feet;
sudden passions of mind; flatulence and elastic
air pent up; muscular and nervous
spasms; plethora menstrual, lacteal, hemorrhoidal,
scorbutick, rheumatick, arthritick,
hysterick, nephritick; calculi in the
biliary ducts; epidemick; aneurism of the
aorta; turgid gall-bladder; spasm in the
abdominal muscles, violent vomiting. In
infancy, corrupted meconium, crudity, and
sour or adulterated milk; suction to excess;
acrid bile; the mother or nurse fasting
too long before the infant sucks; corrupted
unwholesome milk of nurses; nurses
addicted to passion, to dram-drinking; insufficient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">{282}</a></span>
exercise of the infant; tight rollers
round its abdomen; dentition; worms.</p></div>

<h3 class="header"><i>Gall-Stones</i>,</h3> <p class="header">calculi cystici. We have no
account of this disease in ancient records.
Until the beginning of the present century,
it had escaped the vigilance of medical observation.
But it is now known, that biliary
concretions are, perhaps, not less frequent
than those in the urinary organs.
Gall-stones infest more the adult, old, and sedentary;
and it is alledged, more females than
males.  The symptoms at first are dubious,
and are all to be weighed together in forming
a diagnostick. In attempting to descend
throughout the gall-ducts, they excite direful
pain at the pit of the stomach and hepatick
region, darting to the back, with restlessness,
anxiety, dyspnœa, jaundice-colour of the
eyes, costiveness, and commonly vomiting:
the pain is aggravated by coughing or
sneezing, and sometimes ascends to the right
shoulder and arm; but the pulse and circulation
are not accelerated.</p>

<p>In the expulsion of these calculi, there are
usually reiterated paroxisms, or exacerbations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">{283}</a></span>
and remissions of pain. The continuance
of the paroxisms is from a few
hours to days, weeks, or even months; but
the latter is rare; during which period either
no stone is discharged, or one or many
stones are successively protruded.  Their
immediate expulsion is accompanied with
a sensation, as of something bursting in that
part, or of a fluid rushing into the intestines;
and often some tenderness is there left behind.
The calculi vary in shape, colour,
consistence, size, and number; from a pea to a walnut,
and from one to dozens and scores. It
is generally a tedious and chronic disease,
and may continue many years; often thro’
life. It is seldom immediately dangerous,
unless, as in nephritis, inflammation is kindled,
or during pregnancy.  When chronic
and inveterate, it may terminate in jaundice,
cachexy, dropsy. The symptoms of calculi
in the gall-bladder are obscure; such
as weight, uneasiness, dull heavy pain at intervals,
sometimes temporary jaundice, cachexy,
and diseases of the stomach. The
<i>causes</i>, hereditary, viscid, tenacious bile, sedentary
life, depressing passions, spirituous
liquors; often ambiguous.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">{284}</a></span></p>

<p>Whether any calculous concretions are
formed in the pancreatick duct, is yet unexplored
by authors. The pancreatick fluid
is nearly similar to the saliva, which separates
a tartarous sediment on the teeth.</p>

<h3 class="header"><i>Jaundice</i>,</h3> <p class="header">icterus, morbus regius. Some
of the eastern nations have naturally this
complexion. The mortality by jaundice is
not inconsiderable, amounting in the London
bills, in the last thirty years of the preceding
century, to 2169; and in the present
century is doubled. The symptoms,
heaviness and aversion to motion, itching
and dryness of the skin, yellowness of the
tunica-conjunctiva of the eyes, and also of
the skin; the urine of a saffron-colour, and
tinging linen; objects appear yellow; there
is thirst, bitter taste in the tongue, bitter and
yellow saliva, inappetency, indigestion, costiveness,
and frequently pale-coloured feces.
Sometimes, though very rarely, jaundice is
local and not general. Jaundice may be critical,
symptomatick, idiopathick, periodick,
chronick. From gall-stones it is generally
periodical; and such are prone to relapses.
The prognosticks are more favourable with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">{285}</a></span>
natural sweats; in recent than in chronic;
in youth than in old age; in robust than in
weak persons; in yellow than mulatto
tinge; and when not complicated with
other dangerous diseases, especially dropsy.
Its duration and termination is various; from
a few days to weeks, and months.</p>

<p>The predisposing and occasional <i>causes</i> are,
sand, mucus, or inspissated bile in the biliary
ducts, especially the ductus communis; tumors
compressing the biliary ducts, or their
concretion; scirrhous duodenum; spasmodic,
and flatulent colick obstructing the intestinal
orifice of the biliary ducts; violent passions
of mind; strong emeticks or purgatives; sudden
refrigeration of the body; hepatic obstruction
and inflammation; languid circulation
through the vena porta, sedentary
life; warm climates and broken constitutions;
excess of bile and re-absorption; cachexy;
depraved state of the blood; symptomatick
in some intermittent and remittent
fevers, pregnancy, scurvy, obstructed spleen;
venomous bites and stings. In infants, excess
of bile and meconium, or distention of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">{286}</a></span>
the duodenum obstructing the biliary excretory.</p>

<h3 class="header"><i>Worms.</i></h3> <p class="header">In assigning an adequate share
of mortality to worms, the London bills,
probably, are defective. During the last
thirty years of the preceding century, they
are rated at only fourteen hundred; and
continue decreasing throughout the present
century. Perhaps a portion of verminous
mortality is confounded with colick and
gripes, or with hectic emaciation. Worms
infest most in infancy and childhood; but
seldom until after ablactation; and then, probably,
more of the children of the necessitous
than of the affluent. The principal
species of human worms are the rotunda, or
lumbricalis, the tænia or lata, the cucurbitina,
and the ascarides: these are again,
but with superfluous subtility, subdivided by
nosologists. The rotunda or lumbricalis, has
most resemblance to an earth-worm; it is
forked at both ends, but paler: in length
various, from inches to feet: and often many
are entangled together in clusters. The tænia
has some resemblance to tape, consisting
of numerous joints, or coherent links, about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">{287}</a></span>
an inch or more distant, and often many yards
in length: this is most frequent in the
adult age. The ascarides are extremely numerous,
active, and minute, like fine needles,
or the cuttings of white thread; and generally
burrow in the lower extremity of the
intestinal tube of children: the former species
wallow through all parts of the alimentary
canal.</p>

<p>Verminous symptoms are numerous, various,
and all extremely ambiguous, unless
worms are discharged with the feces: feculence
in the stomach and intestines may occasion
all the other symptoms: such as pale
countenance; fugaceous flushing of the face
and cheeks, and circumscribed spots of redness;
itching of the nose; swelling of the
upper lip and nose, and lower eye-lids; dilatation
of the pupil; grinding of the teeth;
fetid breath, and eructation; flow of saliva;
irregular, impaired, or voracious appetite,
nausea, vomiting, colick, gripes and sudden
screams from the violence of pain; tumid
and enlarged belly; costiveness, or diarrhœa
and fetid stools; the urine sometimes like
milk; sudden startings in sleep, frightful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">{288}</a></span>
dreams; palpitation of the heart; dry hectic
cough, atrophy; various nervous symptoms,
epilepsy, tetanus, convulsions. The
ascarides excite irritation about the anus, tenesmus,
and dysury. These intestinal insects
are often most tormenting when the stomach
and intestines are empty. Sometimes
they excite a symptomatick and slow fever,
with hot skin, quick pulse, thirst; and the
children are then confined to bed. But
without fever, children pursue their usual
amusements. The <i>causes</i>, improper diet for
these years, as cheese, farinaceous, legumens,
fruits, saccharine, putrid diet or unwholesome
aliment, hereditary weak constitution, moist
air: the ova of the insects swallowed with
the air, food, or drink.</p>

<h3 class="header"><i>Hemorrhoides</i>,</h3> <p class="header">piles. Is a frequent and
very universal disease in both sexes, and most
so during the adult stages and decline of
life; and by which the lives of many are
incommoded and harassed. They are distinguished
into the blind and open, the external
and internal; and are temporary, periodical,
and chronic. The blind piles denote
small imperforated lumps and tumors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">{289}</a></span>
about the margin of the anus. Sometimes
the tumours and hemorrhage from the anus
ensue without any previous disease of the
body; but generally some antecedent or accompanying
disorder is felt; such as vertigo,
headach, pain of the back and loins, oppression
in the breast, colick, dysury, some fever and
heat. The approaching hemorrhage is with
sense of fulness, heat, itching, and pain about
the anus, with tenesmus, costiveness, and conglobated
feces; and sometimes is preceded by
a serous discharge, or this sometimes is substituted
for red blood. The quantity of sanguineous
extravasation is various in different
persons, and in the same person at different
periods: from the internal vessels of the
rectum it is more profuse than from the external;
and is generally during, or after the
fecal discharge: in other cases it is without
fecal efforts, and then in larger debilitating
streams, but rarely immediately fatal.
These tumors, or sanguinous torrents, are almost
always periodical, and at various intervals.
They are often salutary, if moderate,
especially if bad health preceded; and also
as preservatives. In the decline of life, when
the hemorrhoidal flux has been frequent,
but suddenly ceases, they are in danger of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">{290}</a></span>
apoplexy or palsy. On the other hand, in
excess, it may exhaust the body, injure the
health, and terminate in dropsy or consumption.
Or sometimes hemorrhoidal tumours
inflame, suppurate, and form fistulas
in ano.</p>

<p>The predisposing and occasional <i>causes</i> hereditary;
plethora, dense blood, luxurious
living, indolence and stimulating diet; intemperance,
especially in spirituous liquors;
dried indigestible diet; suppression of the
menses, and their final cessation, and of
other critical evacuations; obstructions of
the liver, spleen, of the mesenteric and hemorrhoidal
veins; reiterated and severe colick;
abrasion of the intestinal mucus; acrid
purges; acrimony of the blood; costiveness,
and hardened feces; worms; sitting too long
on the necessary, and over-warm steams, or
stoves; long sitting, riding, and compression
of the hemorrhoidal veins; diseases of the vagina,
womb, and neck of the bladder; prolapsus
ani; pregnancy; rupture of the extremities
of the iliac arteries; effusion of blood
into the cellular texture of the intestines, near
its extremity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">{291}</a></span></p>

<h3 class="header"><i>Vomiting of Blood</i>,</h3> <p class="header">hematomosis, vomitus
cruentus, is a very rare disease. It is
said to be more frequent in females than
males; and is an adult malady. The symptoms,
weight, straitness, and anxiety at the
region of the stomach; nausea, cardialgy,
efforts to vomit, and discharge of blood without
coughing: the colour depends upon the
time it has lain in the stomach, and is with
various intermixtures of food, bile, pituita:
there is also great prostration of strength, and
proneness to faint. The quantity of this extravasation
is various, from ounces to pounds;
and frequently some portion descends by the
anus. It is extremely dangerous, either immediately,
or in its consequences. If with
fever and great force in the discharge, it
may destroy in a few paroxisms; or if
chronic, may end in dropsy, consumption,
or diseases of the stomach and intestines.
Slight eruptions have relieved chronic maladies
of the liver and spleen, hypochondriasm,
hystericks, and intermittents. From
obstructed menses it is much less alarming.
The <i>causes</i>, obstructions of the liver,
spleen, menses, hemorrhoids; scirrhus of the
stomach and liver, or spleen; suppression of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">{292}</a></span>
habitual discharges or evacuations, or old
ulcers; dregs of intermittent fevers; scorbutick;
acrids and poisons swallowed, and
violent efforts to vomit; worms; violent passions;
external injuries.</p>

<p><i>Poisons.</i> By poisons conveyed through
the mouth or wounds, very few of the community
are destroyed. The ancient Asiaticks,
Greeks, and Romans, were infected with
the silly infatuation and apprehension of constantly
swallowing poison in their aliment.
This was not an epidemical error of the
rabble, but had spread amongst their emperors
and philosophers: hence the pompous and
absurd compositions of mithridate, theriac,
and other poisonous antidotes. None of the
two hundred genera of the quadruped creation,
nor of birds, are poisonous; and very
few of the fish, or of the numerous insects
and reptiles. Out of the many thousand
genera of the vegetable creation, the poisonous
are comparatively trifling: such are
the napelli, apocyna, strammonium, solanum,
laurus, aconitum, manchinel, cicuta, opium,
and a few others; some of which, however,
are powerful remedies. Of the mineral, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">{293}</a></span>
metals and semi-metals, arsenick excepted,
the preparations of lead, copper, and mercury,
are also amongst the potent remedies.</p>

<h3 class="faux" title="Poisons"></h3>

<p>Of poisons, some corrode or burn, others
are septic; and by far the greatest number
attack the vital principle, by either violent
irritation or torpidity: some have a more
deadly malignity than others, and are more
speedily destructive. Most of the vegetable
poisons excite narcotic, stupifying, vertiginous,
lethargic, convulsive, and emetic
symptoms, affecting the brain, external
senses, heart, and stomach. The minerals,
as arsenick and corrosive sublimate, excite
symptoms of inflammation in the stomach,
in the most violent degree; and both copper
and lead of spasmodic colick also. From
their readier solution in the stomach, the
vegetable poisons, except by the symptoms,
can rarely be subjected to ocular detection;
but by certain chymical analysis, when in
any considerable quantity, the mineral may
be discovered. Arsenick has a milky whiteness,
is gritty and insipid; part of it swims in
water, like a pale film, the greatest part
sinking to the bottom undissolved: thrown on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">{294}</a></span>
a red-hot iron plate, it does not flame, but
rises in thick white fumes, which have an
offensive smell of garlick, and cover cold
iron held over them with thick flowers:
arsenick inclosed between two plates of copper,
then put into the fire and made red-hot,
changes copper white. Copper is soluble
in all acids, and assumes a blue colour
when corroded by any acid or saline
substance. Preparations of lead have a peculiar
sweet taste; and wine adulterated with
lead is detected by any alkali, which renders
the mixture turbid, and precipitates the metal.
These observations are a part of medical jurisprudence;
and we shall hereafter touch
upon it, under Female Abortion, and External
Violence, especially injuries of the
head.</p>

<h3 class="header"><i>Hydrophobia.</i></h3> <p class="header">This disease may be classed
with the mental, or with poisons, and
spasmodic affections of the superior part of
the alimentary canal. There are very few
instances of this disease in Britain: it is,
notwithstanding, one of the modern hobgoblins,
in which we rival the folly of
the ancients respecting alimentary poisons.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">{295}</a></span>
It should first be indisputably ascertained
whether the dog, or other animal, was mad
or not: we have a thousand false alarms,
forgeries, and falsehoods in this respect.
Dogs, especially puppies, are subject to periodical
short fits, in which they run about
as if mad, barking incessantly, and with a
querulous angry voice. The symptoms
of a mad dog, as described by authors, are,
he suddenly becomes mopish, peevish, and
morose; has an aversion to food and drink;
an unusual look about his eyes; he runs
about disorderly, forgets his master; his
voice changes to a shrill bark; he suffers no
one to approach, or to handle him, but
bites at those who attempt it; he deserts his
own habitation, running with his head and
tail drooping; the tongue hangs out of his
mouth, covered with foam and slaver; other
dogs fly from him with horror; he attempts
to bite all who fall in his way; he flies
from water and rivers, and at length falls
down exhausted, and dies on the third or
fourth day after the first appearance of the
disease. It is also agreed, that canine madness
is more general in hot climates, and in
the hottest summers of northern. But unfortunately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">{296}</a></span>
hitherto, in most cases, probably
nineteen out of twenty, the mania of dogs
has not been incontrovertibly decided; as
in cases even at the commencement, when
it is very dubious, dogs are very improperly
and impolitickly destroyed, instead of being
confined in a place of security, to observe
whether the poison is fermenting in them.
Hence, probably, much ideal terror and horror;
and boasted, though impotent, virtues
of many vulgar nostrums, panaceas, and
antidotes.</p>

<p>In the human species, Hydrophobia, phrenitis
latrans, rabies canina, aquæ fugax,
is described, for I never saw an instance of it,
in the following progressive train of symptoms;
some days or weeks after the bite
and wound, heaviness, lassitude, disturbed
sleep, frightful dreams, restlessness, melancholy,
pain in the wounded part; exacerbation
during the phases and changes of the
moon; aversion to food and drink, pain in
the throat, difficulty or impracticability of
swallowing, fluids especially; and horror,
or even convulsions, at the sight of any
fluid; in some, delirium; in others, the senses
perfect. There are some instances of recovery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">{297}</a></span>
in the stages of hydrophobia. The
diseases from other venomous bites and stings
are transferred to the future class of external
accidents.</p>

<h3 class="faux" title="P. S. Costiveness, and nasal hemorrhage"></h3>

<p><i>P. S.</i> In the preceding group of diseases
may be included two, which I had no opportunity
to introduce sooner: these are costiveness,
and nasal hemorrhage. Costiveness, it
is true, is frequently symptomatic in many
diseases, but is also idiopathic; and the suppression
of this excretory during several days,
occasions vertigo, headach, disturbed sleep,
inappetency, indigestion, flatulence, colick,
&amp;c. The <i>causes</i>, obstruction or constriction
of the intestinal tube; faults in its muscular
fibres, diminution of irritability by age or disease;
defect of mucus, bile, especially cystic
bile, its inertness; costive food and drink, and
medicines; too little drink; excessive discharge,
by perspiration or urine; indolence,
and hard feces. Nasal hemorrhage predominates
principally in the adolescent age, and
towards puberty and manhood, and more
amongst the male sex: the hemorrhage is
generally periodical at irregular intervals,
usually from one nostril, and slight, or in
torrents: and there are instances on record of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">{298}</a></span>
many quarts of blood being discharged within
a few days. After puberty it commonly
abates, and some years later ceases. The hemorrhage
is very seldom immediately fatal;
and more dangerous diseases have followed
its rash suppression. The causes will be
comprehended from those of hemorrhages in
general.</p>

<h2 class="header"><a name="Diseases_of_the_Urinary_Organs" id="Diseases_of_the_Urinary_Organs"></a><i><span class="first-word">Diseases</span> of the Urinary Organs.</i></h2> <p class="header">We
shall begin with the diseases of the first
urinary strainer, the kidneys, descending progressively
through the conduits and reservoir,
the ureters, bladder, and urethra. During the
last 30 years of the preceding century, those
marked in the mortal catalogue of London
as cut of the stone, gravel, and strangury,
are only 1796; and at present the mortality
is more inconsiderable; and perhaps, in some
degree, maybe accounted for by modern improvements
in the cure of the venereal disease,
and in the operation of lithotomy; for
as to lithontripticks, we are as yet as ignorant
as of the philosopher’s stone. From Dr. Dobson’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">{299}</a></span>
Treatise it appears, that out of 192,394
sick of various diseases, medical and surgical,
in different county hospitals, throughout
England, 430 of these underwent the
operation of lithotomy. Some countries
more than others, are obnoxious to calculous
concretions; which have been variously imputed
to air, food, drink, and water. Gravel
and sand in the urinary organs is a frequent
complaint, to which infancy and childhood
are by no means such martyrs as adults,
those especially in the decline of life: but
from the shortness and width of the female
urethra, they are preserved freer from calculi
in the bladder than the male sex. Diseases
of the urinary organs have been often described
by authors under three general heads;
Ischury, Dysury, and Strangury. Ischuria
means a total suppression of urine; and from
the seat of the disease is called renalis, uretoria,
vesicalis: Dysury is only a slighter degree
of the former: Strangury, a constant
irritation to urine, in small quantity, and
often with tenesmus.</p></div>

<div class="force_p"><h3 class="header"><i>Inflammation and Calculi of the Kidneys</i>,</h3>
<p class="header">nephritis, nephralgia: and generally confined
to one kidney. The symptoms, shivering,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">{300}</a></span>
fever, acute pains and heat in the lumbar
region, following the tract of the ureters,
and various in severity, from calculi excruciating;
frequent efforts to micturition; the
urine in small quantity, red, bloody, hot,
often intermixed with sand, sometimes totally
suppressed; with colick, flatulence, bilious
vomiting, costiveness. When the disease
is severe, and from calculi, there is
stupor of the leg of the same side, and pains
in the groin and male testicle, and often
retraction of the latter. There is also difficulty
and pain in walking or erecting the
body; but the rheumatick lumbago, with
which it may be confounded, has no concomitant
fever, nor disorder of the stomach;
and has more intense pain on bending or
erecting the body. It is always dangerous
and precipitate, especially when the urine is
suppressed, terminating within seven, or, the
utmost, fourteen days, by discussion, suppuration,
gangrene, scirrhus: discussion indicated
by a copious flow of urine and
sweats.</p>

<p>But the most frequent malady about the
fountain of the urinary secretion, is from
calculi in the ureters. The kidneys have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">{301}</a></span>
few nerves, and therefore not very acute
sensation. Calculi or gravel in the strainers
of the kidneys, seldom excite much uneasiness
until they are forced into the ureters by
the current of urine, by exercise, exertions
of the body, agitations of a coach, passions
of mind, stimulating diet and drink: then
they excite atrocious pain, like a stake driven
into the back, which is exasperated by certain
postures, by every motion of the body,
and by a full stomach; together with all the
other symptoms common to inflammation,
except the fever; to which, however, and to
inflammation calculi, often give birth. At
the beginning the urine is limpid; afterwards
it becomes turbid and fabulous. This
is a chronic periodical disease, with intermissions
and nephritic exacerbations at uncertain
intervals. It is distinguishable from
intestinal colick by the pain fixed in the
loins, the urinary obstruction, stupor of the
leg, and retraction of the testicle.</p></div>

<p><i>Inflammation and also Calculus of the Bladder.</i>
Of cystitis, the symptoms are acute
burning pain in the region of the bladder
and perineum, and extending to the loins;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">{302}</a></span>
tumour, tension, and hardness of the abdomen
from the distended bladder, which may
be felt between the pubis and navel; and sometimes
is turgid to an enormous magnitude;
perpetual painful efforts to urine and stool,
and the urine either suppressed, or in small
quantity; a finger introduced into the anus,
or into the female vagina, feels the vesical tumour;
or if the inflammation particularly
fixes upon the neck of the bladder, the surgical
catheter cannot, without immense difficulty,
be introduced; and with all these
symptoms, symptomatick fever, quick, hard,
phlogistic pulse. It is very rapid and dangerous:
total suppression within a very few
days excites burning fever, lethargy, delirium,
convulsions, gangrene: or even after recovery
from a violent disease, incontinence of
urine may remain for a considerable time.</p>

<p>Of calculus, or stone in the bladder, the
symptoms are all dubious, without sounding
the bladder with the surgical instrument. It
is a chronic disease, slow in accumulation;
and is frequently endured many years, without
having recourse to lithotomy. The symptoms
vary in severity, and recur in exacerbations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">{303}</a></span>
at uncertain intervals; such are frequent
irritation to urine, and difficulty in the evacuation;
strangury, tenesmus, pain, and titillation
of the glans of the penis, and the
urethra, especially after making water; itching
of the genitals; sometimes bloody urine
after riding, or exercise. If the stone is
large, there is a sensation of weight in the
region of the pubis and perineum; sudden
stoppage of the urine during micturition;
sometimes necessity of kneeling, and of a
prone posture in endeavouring to evacuate the
bladder. A finger introduced into the anus,
will sometimes feel the stone; but the sound
is the only certain criterion. The size, shape,
and number of stones are various: often only
one, but sometimes several are extracted by
lithotomy. Internal incrustations, and also
scirrhus of the bladder, or even internal hemorrhoides,
have imposed on medical judgment
as cystic calculi.</p>

<p>Inflammation and obstruction of the urethra
cannot be thoroughly investigated, without
a description of the venereal disease, to
which we have not yet arrived; but which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">{304}</a></span>
there could be no impropriety to introduce
amongst this group.</p>

<p>The predisposing and occasional <i>causes</i> of
urinary suppression, obstruction, and strangury,
whether originating in the kidneys,
ureters, bladder, or urethra, are inflammation
of the kidney or ureter, calculi or sand in
the kidneys or ureters; acrid diureticks; spirituous
liquors; plethora, spasm, poisons,
severe riding, violent heat and muscular exercise;
strains of the lumbar and dorsal muscles;
long continued posture in a bent position
or supine on the back; inactive sedentary
life; wounds, contusions, abscess; defecation
and crisis of other diseases by the kidneys;
scirrhous, incysted, dropsical, paralytick
kidney; gout; inflammation of the bladder
or its sphincter, stone in the bladder; the
urine too long retained in the bladder, by
which it becomes violently stretched, and
paralytic; hernia of the bladder; obstructions
in the neck of the bladder, or in the
urethra; varicous blood vessels; the prostrate
glands or seminal vesicles scirrhous, or
enlarged; inflammation, caruncles, and stricture
in the urethra; the corpus cavernosum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">{305}</a></span>
thickened; contiguous diseases of the anus,
vagina, and womb; hardened feces, hemorrhoides,
wounds of the rectum, fistula; ulcers
of the womb, obstructed menses, or their
retention in the vagina; pregnancy; ulcers
and worms in the kidneys, bladder, or urethra,
and excretion of acrid pus or membranes,
by urine; grumous, extravasated blood
in the bladder and urethra; inspissated semen
after coition; excess of venery; too acute
sensibility of the urethra, defect of mucus;
acrid urine; tartarous and astringent wine or
drink, food, or medicines; stimulating food
and drink; frequent ebriety; terrestrious
water; sudden refrigeration of the body;
contusion; old age; plethora; lunar, venereal,
rheumatick, arthritick, hysterick, scorbutick,
dropsy, violent colick, retraction and
shrinking of the penis.</p>

<h3 class="header"><i>Incontinence of Urine, and also Diabetes.</i></h3>
<p class="header">Of incontinence, or eneuresis, authors make
three species; one involuntary, without sense
or effort; the second involuntary, but with a
knowledge of its excretion; the third involuntary,
during sleep. The Diabetes was unnoticed
in the London bills until the present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">{306}</a></span>
century; and perhaps its trifling depredations
were thrown amongst consumptions.
It denotes a chronic discharge of urine beyond
the natural quantity, and sometimes exceeding
in weight all the fluids and solids taken by
aliment: it is generally clear and colourless,
but sometimes white and chylous, or unctuous,
or, like honey dissolved in water, a yellowish
green, and tastes sweet like honey: there
is unquenchable thirst, intense heat, flow hectic
and emaciation, pain in the loins; increased
flow of saliva, voraciousness, or inappetency.
It often invades by slow and imperceptible
steps, and without any other disorder, until,
by long continuance, emaciation is visible, with
debility and obscure fever. It is sometimes
periodical, and in hystericks symptomatic.</p>

<p>The predisposing and occasional <i>causes</i> of
incontinence of urine are, palsy of the sphincter
of the bladder, from either too great dilatation
and accumulation of urine, or from violent
efforts in parturition; debility, old age,
excess of venery; fistula, abscess, ulcers, lithotomy,
stone, spasm, gout, apoplexy, palsy,
external injuries. Also, copious, watery, acrid
urine: the bladder irritable from inflammation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">{307}</a></span>
ulcers, excoriation, defect of mucus;
spasm, relaxation of the sphincter; weakness
of the sphincter ani, and accelerator muscles;
pregnancy, laborious parturition; compression
and irritation of the bladder; habit.—Of
diabetes, aqueous tenuity, and also
acrimony of the blood; weakness, laxity of
the kidneys and renal vessels; the crassamentum
of the blood not cohering with the
serum; faults in the assimilation of the nutriment,
and sanguification; excess of watery
drink and ebriety; diureticks; sudden refrigeration
of the body, and suppression of perspiration;
unusual determination of blood
and serum to the kidneys; excess of venery;
increase of cutaneous absorption; obstructions
of the abdominal viscera; spasm; nervous;
habit: often unknown.</p>

<h3 class="header"><i>Ulcers in the Kidneys and Bladder, and
Bloody Urine.</i></h3> <p class="header">Of ulcers in the kidneys, thick
fetid urine, sometimes with mouldered fragments
of the kidneys; heat and weight in the
loins; hectic emaciation, stupor of the leg,
and some other symptoms of nephritis. It is
tedious and dangerous. Of ulcer in the bladder,
pain in the pelvis and perineum, exasperated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">{308}</a></span>
at intervals; heat, strangury, dysury; the
urine fetid with intermixtures of pus, mucus,
and blood; sometimes the rectum also is
eroded. Of bloody urine, or hematuria from
the kidneys, ureters, bladder, seminal vesicles,
or urethra. From the kidneys the hemorrhage
is sometimes profuse, and the
blood of various colours, according to its solution
and stagnation in the bladder; and
sometimes coagulated, takes the mould of
the urethra: the urine tinges linen dipped
into it of a red colour, and the blood is coagulable
by heat. There are instances of its
periodical flow, like the menses. The predisposing
and occasional causes of urinary
hemorrhage are the general causes of hemorrhages;
calculi in the kidneys or bladder;
falls, blows on the loins; violent exertion
of the lumbar muscles, riding, exercise;
venery; plethora; obstructed evacuations,
hemorrhoids, menses; hemorrhoids of the
bladder and varicous veins; acrid diureticks;
ulcers, symptomatick in scurvy; putrid small
pox, and malignant fever.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">{309}</a></span></p>



<h2 class="header"><a name="Dropsy" id="Dropsy"></a><i><span class="first-word">Dropsy</span>.</i></h2> <p class="header">During the last thirty
years of the preceding century, Dropsy
and Tympany amount to 23,366. In the
present century, dropsy makes about one
twentieth share in the London funerals. It
has been alledged, that more women die of
this internal deluge than men; and, according
to Sydenham, more of the former at the
final menstrual ebb, than at any other period.
But, so far as my reading extends,
neither the age, sex, mortality absolute or
comparative, have to this day been decided
from facts or numbers; but rather principally
in the mode of tradition, and aphorisms
of individual oracles. I therefore, through
my learned friend, Dr. Sims, procured the
registers of diseases in the Aldersgate Dispensary
of London, which is accessible to all
ages and diseases, and to both sexes: the result
of this scrutiny is as follows:—Out of
70,000, during seventeen years, from 1770
to 1788, the dropsical amounted to rather
more than one twentieth part of the whole
maladies; that is, to 1,188: of which number,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">{310}</a></span>
I find there were of males, 439; females,
749; cured, 674; relieved, 56;
discharged or not accounted for, 275; dead,
186. Of these their sundry ages were, from
birth to the 10th year, 106; from 10 to 20,
53; from 20 to 30, 112; from 30 to 40,
249; from 40 to 50, 321; from 50 to 60,
209; from 60 to 70, 110; from 70 to 80,
23; from 80 to 90, 9. Total, 1,188. These
include every genus and species of dropsy,
the hydrocephalus and hydrocele; neither
of which were numerous: and the former
principally fatal to children under ten years
of age. Anasarca was the most frequent
genus; and next to that, Ascites. Besides,
all cases of anasarca and œdematous legs were
ranged in this dropsical group; nor was it
possible to form an estimate of the genera
separately, as the word Hydrops was often
indefinitely used.</p>

<p>From these data we may draw the following
conclusions: That dropsy is more inimical
to the female than to the male sex:
but at the same time it must be recollected,
that in London, and other cities, the women
are considerably more numerous; which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">{311}</a></span>
somewhat detracts from the comparative excess
in them of dropsical mortality. For
reasons, which medical men of experience
will anticipate, we may add to the dropsical
dead list some of the relieved, discharged,
and not accounted for. It appears, therefore,
that, under skilful medical treatment, rather
more than one half of dropsies, promiscuously,
were cured; that about one third or
fourth died; that dropsical ravages are principally
amongst adults; for notwithstanding
that one half of the community are under
twenty years of age, yet but a small
portion of these are dropsical. It is chiefly
against adults, and those in the decline of
life, that dropsy prowls with slow and sullen
destruction; and is, as 8 to 1, more fatal
after twenty, than before that period. We
may here also observe, that, by retrospection
to a former proposition, a sort of medical
geometry and trigonometry, a gross estimate
may be formed from the deaths, of the number
of dropsical in a community.</p>

<h3 class="header"><i>Dropsy in the Brain</i></h3> <p class="header">and Spine, hydrocephalus,
and spina bifida, is most frequent in
infancy and childhood; but is often very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">{312}</a></span>
difficult to detect, and the symptoms at the
beginning are dubious. The most usual symptoms
are loss of appetite, strength, spirits,
flesh; fixed pain in the head and eye-brows,
drowsiness or restlessness, heaviness, stupidity;
pale countenance and tongue; obscure
or double vision, dilated pupil, insensibility
of the retina, even when exposed to the darting
rays of the sun, or of a candle; the hand
often applied to the head; irregular pulse;
vomiting.  It is commonly slow in increase;
from months to a year, or more. It is seldom
cured; and the fatal termination frequently
palsy and convulsions. The external hydrocephalus,
or local anasarca, is soft and elastic
to the touch, and the enlargement visible.
The spinal dropsy is sometimes complicated
with hydrocephalus; in it a tumour turgid
with fluid, the size of a chesnut, or larger,
is protruded from the opening in the lumbar
vertebræ of infants.</p>

<div class="force_p"><h3 class="header"><i>Dropsy of the Thorax</i>,</h3> <p class="header">hydrops pectoris, and
pericardii: in one or both sacs of the pleura,
or in the pericardium; or in the pulmonic
cellular texture. This is much less frequent
than the abdominal; and is often very difficult<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">{313}</a></span>
in the early stages to be detected, as the
same, or nearly similar symptoms, occur in
some other diseases of the breast: such are
difficult and laborious respiration, especially
on any exercise or motion, or in a horizontal
posture, and gradually increasing; frequent
cough, at first dry, but after some time, with
mucous expectoration; weight and oppression
in the breast; disturbed sleep, and sudden
startings, with anxiety and dyspnœa; necessity
of an erect posture; palpitation of the
heart, and irregular pulse: there is also
commonly scantiness of urine, œdematous tumour
of the feet and ancles; a pasty paleness
of the face; and sometimes a fluctuation of
water in the thorax is perceptible to the patient.</p>

<p>Sometimes it is circumscribed and local;
at other times, it begins by anasarca, and is
complicated with universal dropsy of the
other cavities, or with asthma; sometimes it
consists of hydatides. It is distinguishable
from the empyema, and from the polypus and
aneurism of the large vessels, by the symptoms
peculiar to each. After some fevers,
thoracic dropsy has formed with surprizing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">{314}</a></span>
rapidity in one or two days. The fatal event
is often preceded by spitting of blood, anxiety,
and accelerated respiration. In the dropsy of
the capsula of the heart, the pericardium,
there is difficulty of respiration, and of laying
on the left side; quick, weak, intermittent
pulse, palpitation of the heart, syncope, dry
cough; anasarcous ancles, scantiness of urine:
and sometimes a sensation of fluctuation during
the motion of the heart. In dropsy of the
mediastinum, the symptoms are conjectural.</p></div>

<h3 class="header"><i>Abdominal Dropsy</i>,</h3> <p class="header">including the ascites,
the dropsy of the ovaria, fallopian tubes, and
womb. The ascites, or exudation between
the peritoneum, intestines, and viscera, is
much more frequent than the hydrothorax.
The symptoms are enlargement and prominence
of the belly; sense of fluctuation to
the fingers and ears on striking it with one
hand, and applying the other to the opposite
side; the urine scanty, turbid, and high-coloured;
costiveness; the thirst at the beginning
is inconsiderable, but generally becomes
irksome and insatiable; the skin dry; the
body sluggish, and increased in weight: the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">{315}</a></span>
countenance becomes squalid, sallow, and
unwholesome; the upper part of the body
and arms emaciated, and, sooner or later, the
ancles œdematous. Where there is a large
accumulation of water the diaphragm is impeded,
with difficulty of respiration and dry
cough, particularly in a horizontal posture.
The serous transudation is the general form
of ascites; but sometimes it is of a gelatinous
consistence, and more of coagulable
lymph from the blood, and the fluctuation
not perceptible: in other cases it is inclosed
in numerous morbid cysts, called hydatides;
which cannot be known to a certainty until
after the experiment of tapping. It may,
however, be suspected, where there is no
general cachexy, dropsy, thirst, or scantiness
of urine; where the appetite and sleep are
natural, and the tumour has begun in one
part of the abdomen.</p>

<p>Some survive many years under ascites,
and after reiterated evacuations by tapping;
on the whole, often amounting to several
hogsheads of water. In others, there are
instances of accumulation so extraordinary,
sudden, and profuse, as to render it necessary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">{316}</a></span>
to be drawn off repeatedly in the short interval
of a few weeks. It occurs either singly,
or as a part of universal dropsy. Ascites
encysted; from broken constitutions; unsound
viscera; the consequence of other diseases;
chronic; with decay of appetite; with
urine considerably disproportioned to the
drink, are all species unfavourable, some desperate.
But in the most deplorable stages,
patients entertain some hopes of recovery.</p>

<p>Dropsy of the Ovaria, fallopian tubes, and
womb, are female, and not unfrequent maladies.
It is rarely that both ovaria are
affected. The disease begins with a soft tumour
at one side of the abdomen, generally
increasing by slow gradations, and at length
sometimes to an enormous size and weight,
so as to distend the whole abdomen: it is
accompanied with several ascitic symptoms,
and with pain about the pubis and loins;
but the fluctuation is imperceptible, or obscure;
and the extravasation is often encysted
and gelatinous. That in the fallopian
tubes requires no particular description after
the preceding, which it so nearly resembles.
Both are often incurable.  Dropsy of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">{317}</a></span>
womb is a very rare disease: it has been described
as occurring either in the pregnant
or unimpregnated state; and in the latter
case, as contained within the cavity of the
womb, or between the fetal membranes and
the womb; or within the layers of the
membranes. I cannot find an author to satisfy
my doubts respecting the accurate diagnostick
of this disease; and therefore shall
not copy what I distrust.</p>

<h3 class="header"><i>Dropsy of the Cellular Membrane</i>,</h3> <p class="header">externally,
in the cellular texture under the skin;
the species anasarca, leucophlegmatia, œdema.
It generally appears first in the lower
extremities, and there too only in the evening,
disappearing by a horizontal posture in
the night: at length, it reaches up, progressively,
to the legs, thighs, trunk, and
scrotum; and in some instances, to the face,
particularly in the mornings. The intumescence
of the skin is pale and soft, and, on
pressure of the finger, indents; but is soon
again filled up with water. As it increases
to a universal anasarca, there is difficulty of
breathing, particularly after exercise, scanty
urine, thirst, decay of strength, slow hectic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">{318}</a></span>
diminution of the natural heat, and more or
less insensibility of the skin, which is dry.
Sometimes the legs and thighs only are enlarged
and distended to a monstrous magnitude;
their skin bursts, ulcerates, or is
irritated to erysipelatous inflammation. It
is either complicated with ascites or hydrothorax,
or beginning as œdema, and increasing
to anasarca, it oozes through all the external
cellular texture; and having inundated
all the out-works, proceeds in drowning the
vital organs.</p>

<div class="force_p"><h3 class="header"><i>Dropsy of the Scrotum</i>,</h3> <p class="header">hydrocele. This is
a local disease, confined to the male sex;
and to which all ages are subject. There
are two principal species; that between the
vaginal coat and testicle, and that in the
spermatic chord; and either collected in
cysts, or dispersed through all the cellular
membranes inclosing the spermatick vessels.
In general, hydrocele is confined to one testicle,
at the beginning is not painful, and neither
diminishes nor disappears: it has usually
a conical pyriform appearance, the
large end downwards: sometimes it is very
hard and incompressible; and when the
membranes are much thickened, it is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">{319}</a></span>
transparent: there is slow gradual accumulation
of the fluid from below: it is incapable
of reduction, or return into the abdomen
through the rings: it is not affected by
posture, cough, or sneezing of the patient:
there is neither nausea, vomiting, quick
pulse, nor is the fecal discharge interrupted.
If the quantity of water is considerable, the
testicle cannot be felt, at least not distinguished.
In most cases the spermatick vessels
may be felt at their exit, through the abdominal
rings; but sometimes the hydrocele
tumour reaches up to the rings, and
renders such cases puzzling to discriminate,
as the spermatick chord is then concealed.
Again, hydrocele of the spermatick chord
has been mistaken for rupture, from its ascension
to the rings: this species feels like
a distended bladder.</p>

<p>Hydrocele has not only been mistaken for
rupture, but also for scirrhous testicle, and
venereal induration. Indurated and scirrhous
testicle is rounder, harder, painful, and the
spermatic chord distinguishable at the rings:
it has, however, frequently a quantity of
extravasated and surrounding fluid. Besides,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">{320}</a></span>
scrotal hydrocele and hernia, hydrocele and
scirrhous testicle, hydrocele and encysted
dropsy of the spermatic chord, have been
seen combined. Some hydroceles are several
years collecting: others are very suddenly
formed, especially from extravasated blood,
external injuries, violent muscular exertions;
these likewise have been mistaken for ruptures.
Hydroceles vary in the quantity of
fluid and magnitude, containing from ounces
to several quarts; some are enormous in size,
reaching half-way down to the knees, and
occasioning great load, and pain in the back.
The colour of the extravasated fluid is also
various; clear, limpid, pale, straw, yellow,
grumous, dark, bloody. Many, from choice
or necessity, are contented to drag on life,
not chusing to risk what is termed the radical
operation and cure; but merely by frequent
repetitions of the scrotal puncture or
palliative remedy. Sometimes the skin and
cellular membrane of the scrotum, in inveterate
hydrocele, is prodigiously thickened.</p></div>

<div class="force_p"><h3 class="header"><i>Tympany.</i></h3> <p class="header">There are two species; that
where air is confined within the intestinal
tube; the other, where it is extravasated between
the intestines and peritoneum: this
last species very rarely occurs, and only from
an erosion or hole of the intestines. The
symptoms of Tympanites are, tumour and
tension of the abdomen, and compared to
the stretched head of a drum, without fluctuation
or thirst; and not altered by a
change of posture, nor is the body increased
in weight: there is inappetency, indigestion,
colick pains, eructation, and explosion of
fetid air by the mouth and anus; costiveness,
sallow complexion; and, from the distension
of the abdomen, difficulty in breathing: in
the inveterate stages of the disease, ischury,
dysury, emaciation, hectic, and atrophy. Its
increase is generally quicker than ascites;
it is also chronic, and contumacious to medicine.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">{323}</a></span>
Tympany of the womb is also
mentioned by authors; but is a very unusual
occurrence: it is described by local heat,

The <i>causes</i> of Tympanites are, atony and

of the human machinery, which, from the
days of Hippocrates, have been discriminated
by specifick morbid names, are notwithstanding
unnoticed in the London registers;
unless perhaps rising of the lights, spleen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">{325}</a></span>
and vapours are substituted as a portion of hysterick
mortality. This formidable phalanx,
whose frequency and fatality are of universal
notoriety, must be mustered amongst the
chronic host of diseases. From about the
period of puberty, seldom earlier, they begin
to infest numbers of the female sex.</p> <h3 class="faux header" title="The proportion of menstrual obstruction and excess, and of hystericks, to other diseases"></h3> <p class="header">On
a careful perusal of nearly one half of the
books of the Aldersgate Dispensary in London,
and before mentioned, during six years,
I found the total sick and diseased amounted
to 29,511: by far the greater proportion
of which were adults, and more females
than males. Of this twenty-nine thousand,
the numbers afflicted with different female
complaints were as follow: Obstruct. mens.
and chlorosis, 254; profluvium mens. 270;
fluor albus, 446; hysteria, 1104; total,
2074. Here it is worthy of observation,
that four only of the principal female infirmities
constituted nearly one fourteenth
part of all the diseases in that dispensary,
which is open to afflicted patients of every
description and age. I should, however, not
omit to add, from the information of one
of the learned physicians of that charity, that
under Fluor Albus, a few cases of venereal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">{326}</a></span>
gonorrhœa were concealed; and that under
Hysteriæ, were arranged all female and nervous
complaints, without strictly attending
to its generick symptoms. We have here
likewise, one proof that uterine relaxation is
a more frequent female malady than obstruction
in London: it is more so in warm
than in cold climates: and probably, all
these four female diseases are more prevalent
amongst the higher and luxurious ranks;
and in city than in country.</p>

<p>Hippocrates has truly said, “Uterus sexcentarum
œrumnarum mulieri auctor merito
dicatur.” Great and important changes
ensue at puberty amongst the two sexes,
especially the female, affecting their future
health. In both, the organs of generation
are then evolved, and the sexes first capable
of procreation. The semen in males about
this period, begins to be strained through
the generative organs, the beard to sprout,
and the countenance to assume a more masculine
appearance. That periodical discharge
of red blood from the female womb,
called Menses, the index of womanhood, begins
in this island to gleet monthly, about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">{327}</a></span>
the age of 14, 15, or 16: but its first eruption
and final cessation, as well as its periodical
returns, are sometimes extremely variable;
from 11 to 20 years of age; and its
final ebb between 30 and 50; generally,
however, between 40 and 50. In warm
climates, the menstrual commencement is
earlier, and more profuse. This discharge
is not suddenly in a full stream, but continues
oozing from 3 to 5 days, and even
longer; the whole quantity in healthy women
amounting to 4 or 6, and in others,
to even 12 ounces: but the first efforts to
menstruation are commonly scanty and irregular.
The quantity of blood evacuated,
the duration, the intervals, periodical returns
and effects, are various; and are diversified
by climates, seasons, constitutions, mode
of life, habit, and by numerous other accidental
circumstances. In different women
the menstrual intervals are from 2 to 6 weeks,
or longer; but when strictly regular, or
the woman not pregnant, every lunar month.
The first periods of menstruation, and the
final cessation by age, are two very important
epochs in female life, on which much of
their succeeding health and longevity will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">{328}</a></span>
hinge. But, without entailing diseases,
many women are liable to some menstrual
irregularity, with respect to the periods, duration,
and quantity.</p>

<h3 class="header"><i>Morbid and Irregular Menstruation</i>,</h3> <p class="header">under
the different heads of scantiness, chlorosis, or
morbus virginius, retention, partial obstruction,
and total suppression.  The menstrual
eruption is generally and naturally preceded
by heat of the loins, and weight about the
uterine region, frequently with pain and cholick,
lassitude, headach, dulness of vision,
disturbed sleep, inappetency, and nausea,
pain and load about the breast: all which,
with many other troublesome symptoms,
usually disappear on the establishment of this
salutary and critical evacuation. But where
the menses do not flow at puberty, or afterwards
become obstructed or suppressed, a numerous
train of morbid symptoms and fatal
diseases often ensue; such as inappetency,
indigestion, colick, palpitation of the
heart, difficulty and labour in respiration,
pulmonary consumption, hectic, dropsy, fluor
albus, low spirits, fainting, hystericks, insanity,
apoplexy, general bad health, barrenness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">{329}</a></span>
Indeed, those women who have
passed the stage of puberty some years without
menstruation, are generally barren.—The
Chlorosis appears about puberty, sometimes
indeed earlier; and is more frequent
amongst indolent and luxurious females. The
complexion is pale, sallow, of a green sickly
tinge; the lips pale, with aversion to motion,
with debility, muscular flaccidity, inappetency,
indigestion, craving for unusual and
unnatural food, flatulence, palpitation of
the heart, laborious and quick respiration on
exercise or ascending any eminence; pain and
weight about the loins, night sweats, hectic
and emaciation, œdematous ancles, crude
urine, usually obstructed menses, unusual bad
health, and derangement of the animal, vital,
and natural functions. It is seldom immediately
dangerous to life, but often lays
the foundation of some of those diseases
above enumerated.</p>

<p>The predisposing and occasional <i>causes</i> of
scanty menstruation, obstruction, and suppression,
and of chlorosis, may be comprehended
under the following: general bad
health, debility, and unsound constitutions;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">{330}</a></span>
partial weakness of the uterine vessels; too
great resistance and rigidity of the uterine
vessels; want of sufficient momentum in
the sanguineous circulation; scarcity of florid
blood; not sufficient motion nor exercise
of the body; sanguine plethora; sizy blood;
spasmodic constriction of the uterine vessels;
sudden passions of mind, especially the
depressing passions; cold wet feet; cold liquors
and various cooling luxuries drank or
eat at the menstrual period; crude watery
diet; worms; celibacy; love; salacity
stifled; lax fibre; severe parturition, and local
diseases inherent in the womb and vagina.</p>

<h3 class="header"><i>Uterine Relaxation</i>,</h3> <p class="header">including excessive menstruation,
fluor albus, leucorrhœa. There
is a great similarity in all their causes. We
here treat of menstrual excess in the unimpregnated
state; reserving for pregnancy
that uterine hemorrhage, vulgarly denominated
Flooding. Menstruation may be morbid
from frequency in the returns, from duration,
and from quantity. It has already
been said, that the quantity of the menstrual
flux, the recurrence, and the duration, vary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">{331}</a></span>
in different women: the immoderate discharge
is determined not altogether by the
absolute quantity, but by the effects: such
as languor, debility, pale countenance, weak
pulse, palpitation of the heart; depression
of spirits, pain in the back and loins, inappetency,
coldness of the skin and of the
lower extremities; in the evening œdematous
ancles. Excessive menstruation may
either be sudden and within a few days, or
chronic and persevering a long time beyond
the natural period. There is also erroneous
menstruation from various parts of the body;
of which many extraordinary and monstrous
examples may be seen in the records of medicine.
Menstruation in excess, especially
if chronic, is often accompanied with fluor
albus; and may terminate in consumption
and dropsy, and in many of the diseases enumerated,
under obstruction and suppression.</p>

<p>The Fluor Albus often succeeds or accompanies
excessive menstruation. It is a dripping
discharge from the womb and vagina,
and from the same vessels which exude the
menses, sometimes pale and serous, or often
variously intermixed with yellow, green, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">{332}</a></span>
red tinges; sometimes fetid and acrid, and
either constant or irregularly intermittent.
At the commencement, the usual concomitant
symptoms ascribed to this disease, such
as pain and weakness in the back and loins,
indigestion, &amp;c. only occur when the discharge
is excessive, or long continued. It is
then attended with a pale sickly colour and
countenance, dejection of spirits, palpitation
of the heart, lassitude and debility, pain in
the stomach, loss of appetite, indigestion, flatulence,
acrid and turbid urine, hectic. But
notwithstanding the heat and acrimony of
the excretion in many instances, especially
when chronic and inveterate, yet it may easily
be distinguished from venereal gonorrhœa.
Women of various ages after puberty,
married and unmarried, some even after the
final menstrual cessation, are obnoxious to
this gleet, which is not infectious. The
fatal termination may be in some of the different
diseases consequent of obstructed and
excessive menstruation; such as barrenness,
diseases of the womb; colick, piles, strangury,
hystericks, low spirits, consumption,
dropsy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">{333}</a></span></p>

<p>The predisposing and occasional <i>causes</i> of
excessive menstruation and of fluor albus,
are, many of the general causes of hemorrhages,
already enumerated; plethora, sedentary,
luxurious life, stimulating and nutritious
diet; too long indulgence in warm soft
beds; warm chambers; suppression of usual
and habitual evacuations; weakness and laxity
of the uterine vessels from abortion, violent
evulsion of the placenta, or other injuries
during parturition; difficult and lingering,
and also frequent parturition; general
relaxation, and delicate constitution;
weak nerves; violent exercise, especially in
hot climates and weather; excessive heat of
the season or climate; moist watery climate;
violent efforts of the body or muscles,
or straining of the body and loins;
external injuries, or falls near the uterine
region; excess of venery and salacity, manustupration;
spirituous liquors and drunkenness,
intemperance, immoderate use of tea,
and other warm fluids; immoderate use of
warm baths or stoves; neglect of cleanliness
and abstersion; passions of mind,
frights; impeded perspiration; excess of serum
in the blood; scorbutic habit and acrimony:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">{334}</a></span>
purulent translation to and deposition
upon the womb from other parts of
the body; polypi, fungus, scirrhus, cancer,
ulcers in the womb or vagina; procidentia
uteri et vaginæ, emmenagogue medicines.</p>

<h3 class="header"><i>Final Cessation of Menstruation</i></h3> <p class="header">from years.
This is a dangerous period to women; more
so, perhaps, than any other stage of maturity.
In this island the menses usually cease
about 48, 45, or sometimes at 41, and earlier;
especially after frequent parturition.
The springs of life, or generative powers,
then become effete; but in the male sex, the
faculty of procreation continues ten, twenty,
and in some thirty years later. In most
cases, women do not conceive before menstruation,
nor after its cessation. Towards
the final drain, women commonly are irregular
in the recurrence, duration, or quantity
of the discharge; which is often excessive.
The longer or shorter duration of
menstruation depends, in some degree, on
its earlier or later commencement. Women
who never had children, nor enjoyed sound
health; those whose constitutions have been
impaired by frequent parturition and miscarriages,
and others of delicate nerves and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">{335}</a></span>
structure, all these are frequently obnoxious
to complaints and diseases at the final uterine
ebb. As infirmities and bad health are
frequently removed on the first flow of the
menses, such are also again prone to relapse
in this autumn of life, into nervous complaints,
hystericks, consumption, dropsy.</p>

<div class="force_p"><h3 class="header"><i>Hystericks</i>,</h3> <p class="header">uterine suffocation, and female
nervous diseases.  This morbid Proteus
rarely attacks before puberty, most frequently
between puberty and middle age.
Married and single women are obnoxious to
it; but more so the latter and widows, and
those barren, or irregular in menstruation.
It is not so frequent amongst the laborious
class, or those of clumsy organs, as in the
higher ranks, and particularly in those constitutions
strung to a morbid extreme of nervous
and muscular sensibility and irritability.
It may also affect females of robust muscular
constitutions.  It very rarely attacks the
male sex; the only disease in them, somewhat
analogous to it, is hypochondriasm.
The regular hysterick paroxism generally
attacks by surprize, with a sensation of some
pain and fulness, and of a convoluted ball
or lump, rising up from the lower part of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">{336}</a></span>
belly to the stomach and throat, where it
seems to stick, and excites efforts to cough
it up, or to gulp it down; with difficulty of
swallowing and sense of strangulation, and
often suspension of the functions of voice and
speech. In others, the ball, without ascending,
rolls tumultuously and convulsively
round the abdomen. The paroxisms are preceded
and accompanied with palpitation of the
heart: the patient often falls down in a fainting
fit, turns cold and pale, and the breath and
pulse are scarce perceptible. Sometimes the
paroxism deviates into immoderate laughter or
tears; sometimes into muscular convulsions
and distortions, resembling epilepsy; or into
stupor and insensibility; and there is usually
a profuse secretion of limpid urine; sometimes
there is vomiting. After some remission
and exacerbation, the paroxisms cease, the patient
recovers, stupid, and seemingly dozing,
with repeated sighing and sobbing; and generally
with some remembrance of the paroxism.
The form, duration, violence, recurrence, and
repetition of the hysterick paroxisms are various,
not only in different women, but even in
the same at different times; and, however
alarming in appearance, are seldom immediately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">{337}</a></span>
dangerous to life: but by continuance,
may derange the machine, and lay the foundation
of diseases. They sometimes occasion,
symptoms of dyspepsy; but oftener the appetite
and digestion are unimpaired.</p>

<p>The prolifick brood of what may be
termed Nervous symptoms, or irregular hysterick
paroxisms, in their turn interrupt
and disturb most of the important functions
and organs of the human body; the brain
and nerves; the heart, blood vessels, circulation,
and respiration; the stomach and intestines.
Amongst this medley of afflictions
are nausea and vomiting, flatulence, coldness
of the stomach, depraved appetite, indigestion,
unusual cravings, colick pains, sudden
flushes of heat and cold, formication, transient
fugacious pains, fixed spasms, fainting,
convulsions, headach, general or partial, and
fixed like a nail in a small compass; vertigo,
drowsiness, lethargy; alarm, trembling and
starting at the least noise or surprize; the
spirits sometimes exhilarated to excess, at
other times plunged into despair: to these
may be added timidity, capricious temper,
palpitation of the heart, resemblance of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">{338}</a></span>
spasmodic asthma, flow of limpid urine, or
of saliva, difficulty of urine, night sweats;
“cum multis aliis.” If the symptoms of
each are properly understood, hystericks cannot
be confounded with syncope, epilepsy,
and apoplexy; to all which it has some resemblance.</p>

<p>The predisposing and occasional <i>causes</i> of
hystericks are, excessive delicacy, sensibility,
and irritability of the nervous and muscular
fibres, and laxity of the muscular solids;
retention and suppression of usual evacuations,
especially the menses; scantiness and
also excess in menstruation; fluor albus; profuse
hemorrhages, and other evacuations by
stool and urine; sanguineous plethora; hereditary;
obstructions in some of the abdominal
viscera, or in the circulation of the
vena porta; scirrhous abdominal viscera;
flatulence in the stomach and intestines;
tough phlegm and sordes in the stomach and
intestines; weak stomach; worms; improper
food; drunkenness; indolent, luxurious,
voluptuous, sedentary life; valetudinarian regimen;
irritability of mind; passions of
mind, particularly the disagreeable and depressing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">{339}</a></span>
as cares, grief, disappointed love,
jealousy, frights, intense fixed mental application
to one object, religion, envy, anger,
grievous misfortunes, joy, concealed
uneasiness of mind; celibacy; salacity;
sudden and great changes in the constitution
from menstruation, generation, pregnancy,
and parturition; impure blood, its acrid
tenuity; repulsion of cutaneous eruptions;

difficult and impracticable to dive into the
real efficient causes.</p></div>

<h3 class="header"><i>Childbed</i></h3> <p class="header">Mortality in London is nearly one
eightieth part of the whole funeral catalogue.
It is in storms and hurricanes; or within a
very short space of time. The mortality of
this group must occur between the two extremes
of 16 and 50 years of age. Or, as
marriages in this island, one with another,
are computed to commence on the side of the
woman at 25, we may, with safety, rate the
principal mortality in the stage of life between
20 and 50. On this interesting subject
there are several curious and useful propositions,
which I have attempted to establish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">{340}</a></span>
by demonstrative proof.</p> <h3 class="faux header" title="Abortives and twins, the proportion"></h3> <p class="header">These are, 1st, The
number of women who, on an average, die
in childbed: 2dly, The proportion between
natural, laborious, preternatural, and complex
labours: 3dly, The number of abortive
and stillborn infants to those brought
forth alive: 4thly, The proportion of twins
and tergemini to single births: 5thly, The
diseases principally fatal to women during
pregnancy and parturition, and afterwards,
with the arithmetical ratio and fatality of
each, and also of labours. To the investigation
of these corollaries I proceed in a
regular order.</p>

<p>From twenty-four years of the London,
and from several country registers in England
and Germany, Dr. Short calculates, that
on an average, 1 of every 60 women die in
childbed: others rate the decrement at 1 of
66, or 3 in 200. Upon a much broader
basis I formed a puerperal estimate. From
the year 1700 to 1776, the christenings in
the London registers amount to 1,220,656;
and the abortives and stillborn in the same
interval, to 46,831. The sum total therefore
of the births, including the christenings and
abortives, amounts to 1,267,487. During<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">{341}</a></span>
the above period of 76 years, the deaths in
childbed are 17,057; which number employed
as a dividend to the former, makes
about 1 of 74 pregnant women to perish in
childbed. But as a considerable number of
infants, after being brought into the world
alive, die before baptism or christening, and
consequently are excluded from the publick
enrolment of births and christenings, this is
an additional reason for believing that the
perils of childbed are not rated by us too
low.</p>

<p>Respecting the proportion of natural, laborious,
and preternatural parturition, Dr.
Smellie says, “That of 1000 women in
childbed, 920 of them will be delivered in
the ordinary way, with little or no accocheur
trouble, skill, or assistance: 70 more
of the thousand will be difficult labours,
or slow and tedious, when often some skill
and aid of the accocheur will be necessary;
and the remaining ten of the thousand
will be preternatural labours.” There
will, therefore, according to this author, be
about 8 <i>per cent.</i> of slow, laborious, preternatural,
and anomalous labours, which, in different
gradations, will be more tedious, difficult,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">{342}</a></span>
and dangerous than in the usual process
of nature.</p>

<p>It is a proposition not uninteresting in Obstetricks,
and in medical jurisprudence, and
in many instances it is material to the medical
character, to observe that, in the preceding
list, during seventy-five years in London,
there were brought forth alive and
christened, 1,220,656; that the abortives
and stillborn in the same period were, 46831,
or as 1 of 26.  But, as we just now remarked,
that the chrisoms and infants who
die in the threshold of life, and previous to
baptism, are excluded from the registered
births and christenings; on that account we
may venture to calculate the abortive list to
those who are ushered alive into the world,
as 1 of 27 or 28; perhaps more, or about
3 <i>per cent.</i> Were we, however, to add
the abortions and miscarriages of diminutive
embryos, in the early months of pregnancy,
and which are much more frequent than in
the latter months, the abortive catalogue
would be prodigiously swelled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">{343}</a></span></p>

<p>Dr. Short attempted to ascertain the proportion
between single births, twins, and
tergemini, from a register of three large
parishes, during a series of years, in which
the single births amounted to 11,415; the
twins and tergemini to 311, or about one of
thirty-five.</p>

<p>Lastly, Let us examine what were the several
diseases during pregnancy and parturition,
and afterwards which occasioned this
childbed mortality, and in what arithmetical
ratio were the fatality of those respective
puerperal diseases and casualties. This inquiry
demands a previous analysis of pregnancy
and parturition.</p>

<h3 class="header"><i>Conception and Pregnancy.</i></h3> <p class="header">In some instances,
there is not a more puzzling problem
in midwifery, than to decide the simple
question, whether or not a woman is
pregnant? The symptoms in the beginning
are various and obscure, not only in different
women, but even in the same woman at
different times, and are fallible until the end
of the fourth month of gestation. In the
beginning, one or more of the following indications<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">{344}</a></span>
sway our decision: a slight titillating
pain, or unusual disturbance about the
womb and navel; nausea and reaching to
vomit in the mornings, loss of appetite, sudden
unnatural cravings and longings of the
stomach, heartburn, drowsiness, slothfulness,
chagrin, capriciousness, dislike, moroseness,
aversion to venereal dalliance, headach, tooth-ach,
increased secretion of saliva, tawny circle
round the eyes, and some perceptible alteration
of countenance. But the most unerring
signs of pregnancy are by the touch and feel
of the accocheur’s finger introduced into the
vagina, or rectum.</p>

<p>The womb, a small bag, in shape and size
like a pear, situated within the pelvis, between
the bladder and rectum, and terminated
at its lower part by a soft tube, from
three to six inches in length, called the
Vagina, begins in pregnancy to be enlarged.
About the third month of gestation,
the womb is closely locked up, and
the menses cease to flow: but in some very
rare cases, there is a serous gleet during
pregnancy, and in others plethoric, a small
sanguineous discharge at the usual menstrual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">{345}</a></span>
periods. About the fourth or fifth month,
the womb is considerably distended, and its
upper part ascends above the brim of the
pelvis; by the finger it is felt weighty and
enlarged, its neck shorter, and raised higher
up in the pelvis; and the abdomen begins to
be distended above the pubis. About this period
also, the mother begins to be sensible of
the infant’s motion. For although the heart
and arteries of the embryo, from its earliest,
rudiments, are in action, yet the other muscular
efforts of the fœtus are seldom perceptible
by the mother until the third or fourth
month, increasing in strength and frequency
to the end of pregnancy. Before the end of
the fifth month, the womb reaches up half-way
between the pubis and navel; in the
sixth month, to the navel; in the eighth
month, half-way between the navel and
stomach; in the ninth and last month, to
near the lower part of the stomach, filling
up the whole anterior part of the abdomen.
The uterine enlargement is then not only
perceptible to the hand pressed on the abdomen,
but is also obvious to the eye of the
spectator. In different women, however,
the size of this protuberance is various. Towards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">{346}</a></span>
the latter stages of pregnancy, the
mother’s breasts begin to enlarge, and the
circle or areola round the nipples, is of a
brown colour.</p>

<p>Nine solar months, or thirty-nine weeks,
or 273 days, reckoning from the time of
conception, is the usual period of uterine
gestation in the human species. But, as
conception is often obscure, unless the limited
congress of the sexes can be ascertained,
we must be guided by probable conjectures
respecting the ultimate completion
of uterine gestation; in which women themselves
often err days and weeks. The usual
way of regulating puerperal books, or reckonings,
is by going backwards, and computing
from the middle space between the
last menstruation, and the immediately succeeding
menstrual period which should appear,
but is interrupted to support the fœtus.
Some women are delivered of living children
considerably earlier than the end of the
ninth month; and others, probably, a little
later.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">{347}</a></span></p>

<p>The comparative growth of the fœtus
infinitely surpasses that of its whole future
existence.  But the exact age of uterine
embryos, and of abortives, is, in some degree,
conjectural.  Before the seventeenth
day after conception, its rudiments are not
even visible to the naked eye: the glary
ovum has then slidden down from the ovarium,
through one of the lateral tubes into
the womb. The size of an abortion, comprehending
the fœtus, its membranes, waters,
and placenta, at the end of six weeks,
does not exceed in size that of a pigeon’s or
hen’s, and in three months, a goose’s egg.
About the end of the fourth month, its different
viscera are formed; and its length
between four and five inches. At the end
of the ninth month, the homunculus length,
from head to foot, is from sixteen to twenty-one,
and in some even twenty-six inches:
its weight, from six to ten pounds. Some
extraordinary fœtal giants, however, have
been seen, from ten to twenty pounds in
gravity. Its usual dimensions, so necessary
to obstetrical knowledge, is, from the forehead
to the hindhead, four inches and a
half; from each temple the lateral dimensions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">{348}</a></span>
three inches and a half; the circumference
of the head from twelve to fourteen
or fifteen inches; the breadth of the shoulders
five or six inches, and of the breech nearly
the same; the circumference of the shoulders
and of the breech, from fifteen to eighteen
inches. We might also have observed, that in
gravity, exclusive of placenta, membranes,
and waters, the mature fœtus exceeds considerably
that of the whole menstrual blood,
were it to be accumulated throughout pregnancy.</p>

<p>In the womb, the fœtus is folded together
into a round oval form; and its usual position
is with the head downwards, presenting at
the upper brim of the pelvis, and at the
mouth of the womb; the chin resting on its
breast; one ear turned to the back part of the
mother, the other forwards; the face and hindhead
to the mother’s sides; the thighs bent
up along the belly; the legs again bent
backwards, with the heels to the buttocks;
the arms laid along the infant’s sides, or before
its breast. Thus folded together in a
globular heap, it is wrapped up in four delicate
transparent membranes, and is immerged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">{349}</a></span>
in water, which continues decreasing throughout
pregnancy, and at parturition is various
in quantity, from one to six pints. By its
blood vessels united into what is termed the
navel-string, the fœtus is attached to a flat
round cake, resembling a firm coagulum of
blood, called the placenta, and which is
closely cemented with the mother’s womb.
In this natural posture the mature fœtus lays
above the pelvis, and totally within the abdomen.</p>

<p>Previous to parturition, the fœtus must
descend “inter scyllam et charybdin,” through
that ossious circumvallation, or bony cavity
of the mother, called Pelvis. This cavity is
open, both above and below, and is inclosed
between the hips, groin, and lower part of
the spine. The female pelvis, for obvious
reasons, is more capacious than in males.
In a well formed and proportioned woman,
the common standard is at the upper part of
the brim, from the back part of the spine, or
sacrum, four inches and a half; laterally, or
from side to side, five inches and a half; below,
at the lower opening of the pelvis, these
dimensions are exactly reversed. But as in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">{350}</a></span>
parturition, the os coxcygis, or lower bone of
the spine, is elastic and moveable, on pressure
backwards by the infant’s head, the diameter
of the pelvis below is thereby enlarged in all
its dimensions. The ossious depth of the
pelvis, from the top of the os sacrum to the
extremity of the os coxcygis, is five, or five
inches and a half; at the sides four; before,
or in the interval between the groins, two
inches. In some deformed and ricketty women,
the dimensions of the pelvis are either
throughout, or in particular parts, greatly
contracted, and most commonly at the upper
part.</p>

<h3 class="header">Of <i>Parturition natural</i>, <i>laborious</i>, <i>preternatural</i>,
<i>complex</i>, or <i>anomalous</i>.</h3> <p class="header">Natural labours
are all those in which the infant’s head presents
at the orifice of the womb; which are
probably ninety-nine out of every hundred
labours. But in this presentation of the
infant, some are natural and easy, and a small
number lingering and difficult labours. Preternatural
labours are either all those wherein
any other part of the fœtus spontaneously
presents at the orifice of the womb, or where,
notwithstanding the natural presentation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">{351}</a></span>
the head, yet it is necessary to turn the infant
by force, and to deliver it by the feet foremost.
Complex and anomalous labours are
those, whether natural or preternatural, accompanied
with extraordinary symptoms and
danger, such as floodings, convulsions, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Labour or parturition is a salutary effort of
nature, to expel the contents of the womb
by its own muscular contraction, and the collateral
assistance of the muscles of the abdomen,
diaphragm, thorax, back, and extremities.
These exertions commence at intervals,
called Paroxisms, or Labour Pains, which
are various in strength and duration, from one
to several minutes, and recurring at irregular
intervals of one minute, an hour, or more.
The symptoms naturally preceding and accompanying
real parturition are, anxiety, shivering,
violent pains, shooting from the loins
to the lower part of the abdomen or womb,
and extending down to the thighs; trembling
of the thighs and legs; frequent micturition,
tenesmus, diarrhœa, and involuntary stools,
colick; the countenance and visage florid and
red from the violence of the muscular efforts,
with profuse perspiration and sweats; softness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">{352}</a></span>
of the breasts, sinking of the abdomen in size,
gradual dilatation of the orifice of the womb,
protrusion of the membranes through its orifice
in the form of a soft gut or bladder: in the
absence of the labour pains the membranes and
waters are retracted, at length are ruptured,
when the fœtus may be felt with the finger
introduced: next ensue the spiral descent of
the infant’s head through the pelvis, dilatation
of the external parts round the orifice of
the vagina, expulsion of the infant, its membranes
and waters; separation of the placenta,
exclusion and extraction, together with some
sanguineous discharge. Natural labours are
generally terminated within a few hours,
from 2 to 12 of real labour efforts; sometimes
in a few minutes, and with a trifling
exertion or pain. In some warm climates
labours are alledged to be particularly easy.</p>

<p>But there are specious, or False labour
pains, which are vague and irregular in frequency
and force, and do not produce any
sensible enlargement of the uterine orifice,
and are not attended with any mucous discharge:
they are generally confined to the lumbar
region and abdomen, without extending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">{353}</a></span>
down the thighs; they are most troublesome
towards night, and are relieved by clysters and
opiates. They generally are excited by one
of the following causes, stretching of the
womb, erect posture, spasm in the intestinal
canal, colick, costiveness, distention of the
bladder with urine, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Of laborious, lingering, tedious, or difficult
parturition. Every labour in which the
process is prolonged beyond 24 hours, may
be classed under this head, notwithstanding
the natural presentation of the infant. Sometimes
the labour may continue several days,
either from the head not entering the pelvis,
or, which is much more frequent, from
some impediment during its descent through
that ossious cavity. In these cases the woman
becomes hot, thirsty, anxious, restless, low-spirited;
is afflicted with headach, nausea,
sickness, vomiting, incontinence, and difficulty
of urine; she tosses incessantly, and finds
no comfort in any posture. During this
struggle, the infant’s head advances slowly,
or stops at various parts in its descent; and
the intervals of labour paroxisms are various.
It is by no means necessary that childbirth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">{354}</a></span>
pains should be incessant, or without intervals
of respite and rest. In some cases, tedious and
difficult labours may continue two, three,
and even four days and nights, when, after
reiterated paroxisms, the infant may at length
be excluded by the efforts of nature alone:
in some of these cases also, the mother’s recovery
is surprisingly expeditious, as if she had
been delivered in half the time; and unless
some dangerous symptoms indicate, no manual
assistance will be necessary. It is an obstetrical
axiom, that in labours with the head
presenting, the labour pains continuing strong,
the woman not deformed, the pelvis sufficiently
capacious, the constitution sound, not
exhausted by labour pains nor weak, there is
the strongest reason to expect that nature
will be adequate to the task of delivery.</p>

<p>Indeed, the obstetrical cases, where instruments
are required, are very rare; and in
such emergencies there is often much greater
difficulty to determine the ultimate propriety
of employing instrumental aid, than in the
mode of using the few implements peculiar
to the obstetrick art; consisting principally of
forceps, crotchet, and scissars. The danger of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">{355}</a></span>
the mother, from tedious and difficult parturition,
is discernible from her natural constitution,
her debility, pulse, respiration, voice,
countenance, the duration of the labour, the
weakness of the pains, or their perseverance
and severity, the space elapsed from the entrance
of the head into the pelvis, and from the
rupture of the membranes. The danger of
the fœtus may be predicted from the time its
head has been pressed into the pelvis, and the
violence of that pressure, especially on the
yielding cranial bones.</p>

<p>Preternatural labours are these wherein any
other parts but the infant’s head present at
the orifice of the womb; such as the feet,
breech, shoulders, arms, and so on; besides
those other cases in which, although the fœtal
presentation may be natural, yet, for variety
of reasons, and in dangerous emergencies,
it is necessary to turn the infant in
utero, and to extract it by the feet. The
signs of the preternatural position of the
fœtus are uncertain, until the accocheur can
touch the presenting part. But in all cases, natural
and preternatural, before the rupture of
the membranes and evacuation of the waters,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">{356}</a></span>
it is often extremely difficult to distinguish
by the finger what part is felt. Preternatural
postures of the infant may be suspected,
if the pains from the beginning are lingering,
tardy, weak, making little impression on the
orifice of the womb, consequently tedious labours;
if the membranes are either soon ruptured,
or are pinched up into a conical form,
like the finger of a glove; if no part of the
infant can even be touched until the uterine
orifice is moderately dilated, which remains
high up in the pelvis, and when any part of
the fœtus can be reached, it is indistinct and
irregular, and generally small.</p>

<p>In some preternatural presentations delivery
may be easy; but in general, they are always
precarious, often difficult and troublesome to
the mother and accocheur. After some continuance
of labour the membranes break; but
still no bulky part descends, nor is the mouth
of the womb sufficiently dilated: at length the
labour pains abate in strength and frequency;
sometimes they intermit during a few hours,
and, in some instances, a day or more. When
we compare the size of the fœtus and of the
pelvis, the reason is obvious why in cross postures,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">{357}</a></span>
where the infant descends double, and
is expelled by the natural efforts of the mother,
such cases will be difficult, especially
in first labours; and unless the child is very
small, it will often be born dead. It is true,
Providence has wisely provided, as far as possible,
against puerperal compression, by the
softness of the buttocks, belly, and shoulders,
and by the over-lapping of the parietal bones of
the infant’s head. Infants in the womb, we
may presume, are subject to diseases as well
as casualties; but probably the most frequent
causes of mature abortives and stillborn, originate
from laborious, preternatural, and complex
parturition; which cases, as we observed,
may be estimated at about <i>eight</i> per cent.;
but the abortives and stillborn are not altogether
three per cent.</p>

<p>In a pelvis not two inches wide at the
brim, it is impossible for the fœtus to descend
alive through such a narrow passage. Deformity
at the brim of the pelvis is more difficult
to detect than at the lower part. Some
pelvises have been seen not altogether one
inch in diameter either above or below: but,
happily, such instances of deformity very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">{358}</a></span>
rarely occur. We have but eight examples
on record during the last hundred years in
this island, three of them in London, and
five in Edinburgh, wherein it was thought
necessary to have recourse to the dreadful alternative
of the Cesarian operation; that is,
of cutting out the infant by an incision made
through the mother’s abdomen and womb;
and all these women died. During the above
long interval of time, including three generations,
of fifty or sixty puerperal women in
London, whose pelvises were remarkably
small and deformed, notwithstanding the unavoidable
necessity of recurring to obstetrical
instruments, in order to diminish and tear
away the infant, yet not above five or six
died. We have instances, almost miraculous,
where, after five days strong labour, and a
pelvis deformed and contracted in all dimensions,
yet, by obstetrical perseverance and skill,
the woman has been delivered, and has recovered.
Instructed by these precedents, we may
reasonably expect, that two barbarous and ineffectual
operations, the Cesarian, and the
modern attempt at improvement, by severing
the anterior cartilaginous juncture of the
bones of the pelvis, will both hereafter be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">{359}</a></span>
for ever exploded, at least in this enlightened
island.</p>

<p>Anomalous, or complex labours, are either
natural or preternatural: but at the
same time are accompanied with uterine hemorrhage,
with convulsions, or with two or
more fœtuses; and to these some add the cases
of instrumental delivery. It is natural and
usual for the human species, and for all large
animals, to bring forth one at a birth: twins
often occur; tergemini are rare: four, or at
least five, are not perhaps seen in some millions
of births. Plurality of fœtuses are seldom attended
with peculiar circumstances of danger.
Twins do not occasion much difficulty: they
are generally small; and the remaining fœtus
is seldom discovered before the exclusion of the
first, by which the passage is stretched. Neither
the number nor size, and much less the sex
of fœtuses, can be predicted: a large quantity
of uterine waters will sometimes produce
a more prominent belly than twins, especially
if the infant is at the same time large.</p>

<p>The predisponent and occasional <i>causes</i> of
difficult, laborious, lingering, preternatural,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">{360}</a></span>
and complex parturition, are, on the part of
the mother, ricketty formation, and deformity
of the pelvis; this narrowness generally begins
in infancy, and the common obstruction
or protuberance is at the jetting forward of the
lower lumbar vertibra, or of the os sacrum;
the pelvis may also be too small, without any
deformity or projection; it may be too narrow
from the fore to the back part, above and below,
and at the sides: the os coxcygis rigid; too
great resistance and rigidity of the uterine orifice,
which is a frequent cause; rigidity of the
vagina and surrounding soft parts; first child;
the mother in years, or long intervals between
parturition; the womb too much distended and
stretched, its irregular contraction, oblique
position; the membranes too soon ruptured by
nature or art, and the womb contracting closely
before the infant’s shoulders; the membranes
rigid; the mouth of the womb strait, callous,
inert, irritable; its spasmodic constriction; the
bladder distended with urine; hardened feces
collected in the rectum; piles; weakness of the
mother; tedious labour and fatigue; passions of
mind; terror and fear of the event; the mind
and spirits broken, irritable; the mother delicate,
fat, torpid, plethoric; diarrhœa, profuse
evacuations, floodings, convulsions; heat, cordials,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">{361}</a></span>
strong liquors; improper fatigue and torment
during labour, with fruitless and officious
endeavours in the accocheur to dilate the parts,
and to expedite delivery: the mother’s belly
pendulous; tumours and cicatrices blocking
up the vagina; rupture of the womb; stone in
the bladder. From the fœtus erroneous in position,
and different to the natural; in laborious
cases with the head detained at the brim, or after
its descent into the pelvis: such postures are
vertebral, occipital, auricular, mental, oral, facial.
Of the preternatural and cross positions
authors enumerate; the neck, breast, shoulders,
arms, hands, back, loins, buttocks, breech,
sides, belly, knees, feet. The fœtus may also be
detained by the whole being monstrous in size,
or only in particular parts; such as the head,
shoulders, belly; the head dropsical; the cranial
bones ossified, and not yielding in its descent:
the fœtus dead, emphysematous, and
blown up with putrid air: the navel string
twisted round its neck; two or more fœtuses
entangled; twins growing together; deformed
monsters.</p>

<h3 class="faux" title="The principal diseases in consequence of pregnancy, and also after parturition"></h3>

<p>Having now finished the various processes
of parturition, with the perils and difficulties
that encompass our immediate exit from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">{362}</a></span>
shell, I shall return back to pregnancy, to explore
the different inconveniences and maladies
that ensue in consequence of that state,
both before and after parturition: many of
these are merely temporary morbid symptoms;
some of them rarely occur; others are
attended with trifling danger; and a few only
with imminent hazard. We may include all
these troublesome symptoms, accidents, and
diseases, under the following heads; proceeding
progressively from the beginning of conception
to the end of parturition, with all its
train of evils. These are nausea, indigestion,
vomiting, pains in the stomach, acidity, unusual
cravings, headach, vertigo, costiveness,
difficulty and incontinence of urine, piles, varix,
pains in the back and loins, cramp, colick,
fainting, œdematous legs and thighs, difficulty
and labour in breathing, retroverted womb,
extra uterine conception, superfœtation, graviditas
perennis, moles and false conceptions,
rupture of the womb, protrusion or too low
descent of the womb or vagina, miscarriage
and abortion, dead fœtus, uterine hemorrhage,
convulsions, irregularity of the lochia, including
obstruction, suppression or excess, inflammation
of the womb, puerperal fever, milk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">{363}</a></span>
fever, weed, inflammation of the breasts, excess
and defect of milk, insanity.</p>

<p>The causes of many of these complaints
during the early and latter months of pregnancy,
and affecting the head, thorax, stomach, intestines,
rectum, bladder, and circulation, originate
from sympathetic effects of conception
and pregnancy; from plethora, from the bulk,
weight, pressure, and irritation of the enlarged
womb, and from its stretching, &amp;c.; and either
spontaneously, or by proper advice, cease
before or after delivery. Several of the puerperal
diseases and accidents to be immediately
described rarely occur; and some of them are
without danger.</p>

<p>Retroverted womb is a very rare accident;
where it does occur, it is from the third to the
sixth month after conception, when the impregnated
womb is thereby prevented from rising
above the brim of the pelvis; hence it falls
back, and descends into the interior and posterior
part of that cavity; its fundus becoming
the lower part, and its mouth drawn upwards.
The woman feels weight and pressure about
that region; is afflicted with tenesmus and colick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">{364}</a></span>
pains resembling labour; the feces and urine
are excreted with difficulty; the finger introduced
into the rectum, feels the womb, where,
by crowding the whole lower part of the pelvis,
it compresses and irritates the organs in that
vicinity. Its general causes are imputed to
violent muscular exertions, fatigue, distended
bladder, obstinate costiveness, capacious pelvis.</p>

<p>Extra uterine conception in the ovarium or
fallopian tubes, where the fecundated ovum
is stopped in its descent to the womb. Some
have burst into the cavity of the abdomen, and
formed abscesses in its depending parts; and
others have been gradually, and in fragments,
discharged by the anus. Superfœtation is a
miracle in medicine, and commonly happens
where there is a double womb. Of graviditas
perennis, there are some extraordinary instances,
or of pregnant women advancing to the full
period of uterine gestation, about which time
the fœtus has died, the womb has not emptied
any of its contents, and they have not been
excluded until some years after. Moles and
false conceptions often assume the semblance
of pregnancy, and are generally void of danger.
When the fœtus is deprived of life, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">{365}</a></span>
dissolved in the early months of pregnancy into
a gelatinous state, the placenta and membranes
remaining some time in the womb, acquire
additional bulk, and are called Moles.
Others again are formed merely of inorganic
coagulated blood, after menstruation or flooding,
and, by stagnation, assume that fibrous
compact substance. Moles in general are excluded
in a few months: some have grown to
an enormous size, to double the weight of the
natural fœtus, and remained for years incarcerated
in the womb.</p>

<p>Rupture of the womb during parturition,
is also a very rare accident, and generally fatal;
it occasions severe pains, sudden cessation
of the efforts of labour, and of the descent
of the fœtus, which, if the laceration is large,
by degrees is retracted, and cannot be felt; a
considerable change and irregular protuberance
is perceivable in the abdomen; the pulse
and spirits soon sink, with vomiting, hiccup,
convulsions. Inversion of the womb is a very
dangerous but uncommon accident, and cannot
happen but from gross obstetrical ignorance
or rashness. Descent of the womb and
vagina may be thrown into the general group<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">{366}</a></span>
of ruptures; of which hereafter. The following
comprehend most of the fatal diseases and
accidents during the puerperal state.</p>

<h3 class="header"><i>Abortion and Miscarriage; Uterine Hemorrhage,
or Flooding.</i></h3> <p class="header">Abortion or miscarriage,
or premature exclusion of the fœtus, may
happen through every month of pregnancy.
Early miscarriages between the third and fifth
month, though not recorded in the burials,
are notwithstanding far more numerous than
in the latter months; but are infinitely less
hazardous to women. The mature abortives
and stillborn, are alone thought deserving of
formal interment, and of notice in the registers.
To carry a diminutive embryo, a
Lilliputian in miniature, to a church-yard,
and to bury it with funeral pomp and obsequies,
would be ridiculous. In all probability,
a very great majority of the registered
abortives and stillborn in London, had arrived
at or near the full period of uterine maturity.
Some miscarriages are sudden, with
little or no warning, and with ease; others
again are slow. In early gestation, the gelatinous
ovum is sometimes excluded several
days before the membranes; in other cases,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">{367}</a></span>
there is a discharge of serum days and weeks
before miscarriage. Abortion is usually preceded
by nausea, pain in the back and loins, frequent
micturition, tenesmus, discharge from
the womb of water or of blood. If not in their
immediate, yet in their future consequences,
miscarriages are much more fatal to puerperal
women than appears in the registers.</p>

<p>Floodings are seldom fatal to women before
the two or three last months of pregnancy;
the gradations of danger increasing
to the end of the ninth month, at which period
the uterine blood vessels are enlarged, and
the hemorrhagick torrent is in proportion.
The mouth of the womb also being then less
distended than in ordinary parturition, is more
difficultly forced open to expedite delivery.
Floodings may at intervals, and some weeks
precede natural parturition or miscarriage;
and after a temporary cessation, are prone to
return on the slighted irregularity. Their danger
is estimated from the quantity of blood,
the suddenness of the torrent, and the effects
on the mother; such as paleness, weakness,
coldness of the extremities, quick fluttering
pulse and respiration, fainting, dejected countenance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">{368}</a></span>
weak voice, convulsions: these portend
imminent danger to the mother and infant,
as do floodings near the full period of
gestation, and not accompanied with labour
pains. Uterine hemorrhages may occur not
only in abortion and natural parturition, but
also immediately, or soon after the birth of
the infant, and extraction of the placenta.
Sometimes also during parturition, when the
child’s head blocks up the pelvis, the hemorrhage
has been unperceived, and often unsuspected,
until after the exclusion of the infant:
but the uncommon weakness and faintness of
the mother, without any evident causes, might
have given the alarm.</p>

<p>The predisposing and occasional <i>causes</i> of
abortions and floodings are, frights, terror,
anger, violent agitation of mind or body;
strong muscular exertions and efforts; external
injuries, blows, falls, running, leaping,
coughing, crying, fainting, hystericks; plethora;
errors in the non-naturals; impetuous
flow of blood to the womb, salacity; too much
amorous dalliance; too strait lacing and dress;
hot close rooms; foul air; disagreeable smells;
cravings not gratified; spirituous liquors;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">{369}</a></span>
abuse of emmenagogue, cathartick, and diuretick
medicines; hardened feces and costiveness;
piles; extreme irritability of the body
and womb; weak hysterical constitution; weak
diseased small, contracted, not sufficiently
dilatable womb; weakness of the uterine vessels
from preceding abortion, irregular menstruation;
poor blood; fluor albus; previous
injuries during parturition; repetition
from habit; the habitual tendency towards
menstruation every month; hereditary; acute
or chronic diseases; morbid adhesion of the
placenta, and also coalescence with the womb
from previous inflammation; partial separation
of the placenta; rupture of the vessels
on the surface of the placenta; separation of
the false chorion from the womb; adhesion of
the ovum or placenta to the neck of the womb;
blights of the fœtus, scarcity of nourishment in
the womb, its violent efforts, monstrous size,
its diseases in the womb; rupture of the navel
string, a noose formed upon it; long compression
of the infant’s head or navel string during
parturition; injuries by the hands or instruments
of the accocheur; a dead fœtus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">{370}</a></span></p>

<p>The signs of a dead fœtus are in the mother
subsidence, softness, and coldness of the
abdomen and breasts, sickness, faintness, shiverings,
cold sweats, sensation of a heavy
tumour within the belly, cessation of the motion
of the fœtus after quickening, putrid
discharge from the vagina, evacuation of the
waters, dejected languid countenance: if,
during actual labour, the mother perceives no
motion of the infant, and is cold; no pulsation
can be felt between the interstices of the
infant’s parietal bones, nor at its wrist, nor
navel string; its outer skin easily peels off; it
has a lifeless coldness; and there is a cadaverous
smell and fetid discharge from the vagina.</p>

<h3 class="header"><i>Convulsions</i></h3> <p class="header">may happen before, during,
and after delivery. They resemble epilepsy,
with froth at the mouth, distortion of the
countenance and body; and are a much more
terrific and frightful spectacle than hysterical
and nervous spasms. In the advanced state
of pregnancy, convulsions are still more dangerous,
and, like the sudden impetuosity of
a whirlwind, sometimes close the fatal scene;
especially if at the same time a violent pain is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">{371}</a></span>
felt at the stomach. The plethoric and robust
are not exempt from this tremendous assailant;
but the hysterical and delicate are
the most frequent victims. The predisposing
and occasional <i>causes</i> are morbid sensibility;
profuse uterine hemorrhage; want of due
quantity of blood; plethora; frights; low
spirits; fear, dread, surprize, and sudden emotion
and agitation of mind at this critical period;
dead fœtus.</p>

<div class="force_p"><h3 class="header"><i>Irregularity of the Lochia</i>,</h3> <p class="header">comprehending
excess, obstruction, and suppression. After delivery,
there is generally a gush of red blood,
from about a half to two pounds. The mother
is then weak and infirm, from the fatigue
and efforts of parturition; from the great evacuation
and diminution of the womb and abdomen;
from the loss of blood; from the
agitation and anxiety of mind; and from the
increased irritability: and, according to certain
states of the air and seasons not yet explained,
women are then more than at any
other time prone to fevers. In most cases
the placenta is expelled in ten, twenty, or
thirty minutes after the infant. Afterwards,
the orifices of the uterine vessels continue to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">{372}</a></span>
discharge red blood, which gradually becomes
thin and serous, and even in some degree purulent.
This discharge named <i>Lochia</i>, is various
in duration and quantity, from two to
ten ounces daily, and, gradually decreasing,
in about ten or twenty days is dried up; nature
having then restored the womb to its
natural size: and at this stage all immediate
puerperal danger is escaped. Sometimes there
are great variations in the lochial duration in
different women: in some, they cease after a
few days; in most, after two or three weeks;
and in a few others, not until after one or two
months: the duration and quantity being
varied by climate, season, constitution, mode
of life, and state of the breasts. Lochial excess
is determined more by the morbid effects
than the absolute quantity; such as weakness,
paleness, dejected countenance, feeble
voice and pulse, fainting, convulsions. Or
in its consequences it may more slowly sap
the pillars of health, and occasion consumption
or dropsy. Obstruction and suppression
of the lochia is much more frequent and dangerous
than excess. Most of the usual complaints
after delivery, says Smellie, originate
from obstruction of the lochia, or of milk:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">{373}</a></span>
the former is accompanied with pain of the
back and loins, pudenda, and groins; heat,
shivering, hard quick pulse, restlessness; sometimes
colick and diarrhœa, and difficult oppressed
perspiration.</p></div>

<div class="force_p"><h3 class="header"><i>Inflammation of the Womb</i></h3> <p class="header">begins generally
between the fourth and ninth day after delivery,
and commonly with retention of the
lochia: with fever, heat, and pain about the
uterine region, elevation and hardness of the
abdomen below, with tenderness and acute
sensibility on pressure, irritation to urine and
stools, colick, intense headach, strong full
pulse. The whole, or different parts only, of
the womb may be inflamed, whence the contiguous
viscera of the pelvis will be differently
affected. Where the inflammation is not
violent, the crisis is about the fourth or seventh
day from the attack; but if severe,
may be protracted to the ninth, eleventh, and
fourteenth, and be then discussed with some
sensible evacuation, by perspiration and sweat,
urine, diarrhœa, lochial discharge, or current
of milk from the breasts; or may terminate
fatally in gangrene, delirium, and convulsions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">{374}</a></span></p>

<p>The predisposing and occasional <i>causes</i> of
irregularity of the lochia, and of uterine inflammation,
are, of Excess, grumous clots of
blood in the womb; violence done to the
womb during parturition; retention of the
placenta, or part of it; great weakness; passions
of mind; a second child; spasm; repulsion
of milk from the breasts; too early
and violent motion or walking about; diseased
state of the womb; inverted womb; errors
in food, drink, passions of mind, excretions,
&amp;c. Of Obstruction and Suppression;
clots of blood in the vagina; cold admitted
to the naked body, either externally or internally;
cold rooms, cloaths, and drink; obstructed
perspiration; impure air and close
heated rooms; passions of mind; hystericks;
errors in the non-naturals, diarrhœa. Of inflammation
of the womb, suppression of the
lochia; external violence; falls; rude extraction
of the placenta; morbid adhesion of the
placenta; miscarriage; too tight bandages
round the belly: its termination is by discussion
or gangrene.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">{375}</a></span></p>

<h3 class="header"><i>Puerperal Fever</i>,</h3> <p class="header">or Peritonitis, commonly
alledged to be peculiar to women after delivery,
has been dignified by the moderns, from
its danger and fatality, with a generic name:
happily for the fair sex, it does not often occur:
sometimes it is epidemic, from some unknown
quality of the atmosphere; and in such
circumstances a considerable number of puerperal
women are afflicted at the same time.
It generally attacks one or two days, but
sometimes a few hours after delivery; and
rarely later than the sixth day. The assault
is sudden and violent, with shivering, headach,
especially in the temples and eyes, giddiness,
nausea, sickness of the stomach, and
vomiting of bile in large quantity, pains darting
through the lower region of the abdomen,
and reaching up to the stomach, with extreme
sensibility and tenderness, on being
pressed with the hand, or by coughing or vomiting:
the pain is felt between the stomach
and navel, and is higher than in the inflammation
of the womb; there is unusual languor
and weakness, anxiety, oppression, and
load of the spirits, impaired strength, so as not
to be able to render themselves any assistance
in bed; no refreshing sleep, sometimes delirium;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">{376}</a></span>
the pulse is always extremely rapid, but
various in strength during the revolution of
the febrile paroxisms, that is, of the cold and
hot fit. When the vomiting abates, it is succeeded
by a profuse diarrhœa, accompanied
with colick, tormenting gripes, tenesmus. In
some, the abdomen begins to swell early. At
the beginning the symptoms have an inflammatory
appearance; but after a very few days
change undisguisedly into the nervous and putrid
type, and sometimes with miliary eruption.
Often neither the lochial discharge,
nor the milk, are interrupted; and it has been
observed to ensue even after easy labours.</p>

<p>The puerperal Fever will be affected and
diversified by different constitutions and temperaments,
whether robust, plethoric, or delicate;
by the quantity of the lochial discharge,
the putrid atmosphere in the sick
room, the medical treatment, the state of the
atmosphere and seasons, and morbid quality
of the prevailing febrile epidemick. Between
five and fifteen days terminates the event in
recovery or death. It is always most fatal
when most epidemick, and the sooner it attacks
after delivery. In some of our London<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">{377}</a></span>
hospitals, one half of the women ill of this fever
have died; in others, one of seven. The
crisis by discussion is followed by diarrhœa, by
a serous or purulent transudation from the
omentum or mesentery, into the abdomen;
and from this cause sometimes consumption
and dropsy. Some, even after a favourable
crisis, have recovered slowly. When gangrene
is the direful event, it is commonly within
four or six days from the attack, and is known
by the usual symptoms.</p>

<p>The predisposing and occasional <i>causes</i> are,
a peculiar noxious constitution of the atmosphere;
errors in the non-naturals; anxiety
of mind; hot cordial regimen; heated unventilated
rooms after delivery, and impure
air; hence miliary eruptions and profuse
sweats. The immediate cause is generally
ascribed to inflammation of the omentum,
mesentery, or peritoneum, and the sudden
contraction of the womb after delivery, dragging
and tearing down with it these membranes.
But it merits the most serious and
mature investigation, whether to employ the
remedies accommodated to inflammatory, or
to nervous and putrid fever. We know that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">{378}</a></span>
purulency in the abdomen and thorax is likewise
found in the putrid fever of the West
Indies.</p>

<h3 class="header"><i>After-Pains; Weed, Milk-Fever; Inflammation
of the Breasts</i>,</h3> <p class="header">are far less formidable
foes than the preceding. After parturition,
women are sometimes afflicted for some days
with pains resembling colick; both in torture
and severity extremely harassing. The
<i>causes</i> are, the continued and sudden contraction
of the womb towards its natural dimensions;
fragments of the placenta or membranes,
or of clotted blood in the womb; injuries
done to the fibres of the womb during
parturition; violent extension of the suspensory
ligaments; inflammation and irritation
of the womb, or its neck: tender state of the
intestines; flatulence; flatulent food; suppression
of the lochia; errors in the non-naturals;
a second child. Weed, or ephemera,
sometimes occurs, and is the most simple and
innocent species of fever; it is preceded by
lassitude, slight wandering pains; a succession
of shivering, heat and sweat, resembling an
intermittent paroxism; and in the space of a
few hours, or at the utmost days, the fever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">{379}</a></span>
disappears. The causes are some errors in
the non-naturals. Milk fever: during pregnancy
and parturition the breasts sympathize
greatly with the womb. This natural fever
begins three or four days after delivery, with
shivering and heat, pain, distention and throbbing
of the breasts, shooting to the armpits,
restlessness; after twenty-four hours,
commonly terminating by sweat, diarrhœa,
eruption of milk: the usual quantity of this
nutritive fluid is from two to three pints
daily. In the preceding puerperal stage, inflammation
of one, but rarely of both breasts,
is a frequent affliction, varying in degree and
severity: its symptoms are local redness and
swelling, burning heat, extreme tenderness,
throbbing; and is terminated by discussion,
frequently by suppuration; sometimes by scirrhus.
The <i>causes</i> are impetuous rush of milk
to the breasts; excess of milk; not suckling;
milk obstructed in the breasts or lactiferous
tubes; suckling too soon; obstructed lochia;
cold and obstructed perspiration.</p>

<h2 class="header"><a name="Infant_diseases" id="Infant_diseases"></a><i><span class="first-word">Infant diseases</span></i></h2> <p class="header">every where furnish
a vast supply to the gloomy realms of
Pluto; and this calamity is infinitely aggravated
by the noxious atmosphere of cities and
towns. At birth, an infant is not only ushered
into a new world, but every function of its
frail body undergoes new and sudden changes.
From the human oven of 96 degrees of heat,
it is launched into a variable climate of heat
and cold. A new element of many thousand
pounds weight then presses upon the surface
of its body. This atmospherick fluid, adulterated
in cities with innumerable impurities
and feculencies is drawn into its lungs: its
diaphragm and muscles of respiration then
begin to act, the lungs expand, and the respiration
commences. The passage between
the auricles of its heart and arterial duct are
gradually closed up; the sphere of the circulation
is extended; the whole current of
blood in its frequent revolution hourly, passes
through the lungs; the circulation through
the navel-string, and through which it had
till then drawn its principal nourishment, instantly
ceases: food, for the first time, begins<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">{381}</a></span>
to be taken in by its mouth; the digestive,
with all the numerous secretory and excretory
organs, then begin to perform their different
offices; the tender creature is exposed
to sounds, in a few days to light; the bones
at the superior part of its head gape, and the
brain is there defended by skin only; its
head, belly, liver, and lymphatic glands, are
large, and its extremities slender; the fetal
brain is destitute of ideas; its bones are little
more than gristles and cartilages; its muscles
are soft, flabby, and without swell or expression;
the greatest part of its time is spent in
a state of inactive vegetation; it is unable for
several months to support its own weight, or
to take nourishment, and is then the most
feeble and helpless of all the animal creation.
With such delicate machinery, it has soon to
encounter pain and disease; the assaults of
internal and external enemies; when its
crazy beams and bolts are easily shook asunder
in the first storm.</p>

<p>The acute diseases of early infancy; that
is, under two years of age (small pox, measles,
and a few others excepted) are in the
London registers, principally accumulated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">{382}</a></span>
into two aggregate heaps, <i>Convulsions and
Teething</i>: the former of which forms a dreary
catalogue of astonishing magnitude in London
funerals; amounting to nearly one third of
the whole mortality in the metropolis. But
convulsions and teething are terms too indefinite.
Every infant disease, not immediately
obvious to the senses, is thrust into these two
articles by the ignorant reporters. If we consider
the term scientifically, convulsions, in
multitudes of cases, convey no more intelligence
of the nature of the disease, than if
they had said the child died from want of
breath. Let us therefore examine, whether
the collected observations of medical authors
will not illuminate many dark and defective
parts of the publick registers, respecting
infant mortality. Infants are exempt
from a multitude of the acute and chronic
diseases of adults: they rarely suffer so
early in life from hereditary diseases, cares,
passions of mind, painful impulses of retentive
memory, severe study, intemperance,
hard labour, the inclemency and vicissitudes
of the seasons, and so on. The principal
diseases of infancy may be comprehended under
the following: convulsions, inward spasms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">{383}</a></span>
and tetanus, colick, vomiting, acidity, indigestion,
flatulence, diarrhœa and gripes, thrush,
dentition, hectic fever and atrophy, rickets,
scald head, rash, dropsy of the head and spine,
inguinal ruptures; together with small pox,
measles, hooping cough, worms, and a few
others already described.</p>

<p>As infants cannot by speech express their
pain, we are too often under the necessity to
guess at their complaints by physiognomy,
gestures, and dumb signs: these are principally
manifested by nausea, indigestion, vomiting,
flatulence, refusal of food, or the
breast, diarrhœa and its different colour and
consistence, restlessness, cries, shrieks, agitation
and contraction of the lower extremities,
disturbed sleep, injured respiration, cuticular
eruptions, pustules, and ulcers. In
infancy the pulse and urine are precarious
symptoms: their arterial pulsations in fevers
are sometimes so rapid, that the most minute
divisions of time in horological instruments,
cannot keep pace with them.</p>

<h3 class="header">The general <i>causes</i> of Infant Diseases</h3> <p class="header">and
mortality may be referred to the sudden and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">{384}</a></span>
violent changes after birth in its tender machinery;
to weakness and injuries from tedious
and laborious parturition; delivery before
the end of the ninth month; hereditary
debility; diseased parents; foul air of cities;
improper food and drink; scarcity of food and
milk; ill formed nipples; the tongue tied or
retracted; errors in quantity or quality of nutriment;
too long continuance of vegetable
and acescent food; foul stomach and intestines;
acidity in its stomach; errors of the
mother or nurse in food, drink, rest, exercise,
excretions, passions of mind, ill temper,
passionate, hysterical, addicted to raw spirituous
liquors and drunkenness; diseased;
fasting too long before the infant sucks;
unwholesome milk; adulterated milk and
bread; neglect of cleanliness, and suffering
the infant to lay too long in wet cloaths; insufficient
exercise, and also too violent agitation
of the infant; the ligatures, bandages,
and pins too tight, and tormenting the infant;
improper positions and postures; cold
cloathing and habitations, beds, and scarcity
of fuel, especially in northern regions, and
in winter; infants excretions, and especially
by the anus, defective or excessive; improper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">{385}</a></span>
treatment and quackery of old women and
nurses, and other such medicasters, during
its illness. It is but candid also to confess,
that, in numerous instances, the causes of
infantile maladies are not yet sufficiently established
nor explained.</p>

<div class="force_p"><h3 class="header"><i>Convulsions, Inward Spasms, and Tetanus.</i></h3>
<p class="header">From the exquisite tenderness and irritability
of its frame, most diseases of infants, when
fatal, seem to terminate in spasms, epilepsy,
and convulsions; with which they are infinitely
more afflicted than adults, and often
endure better. Inward spasms are amongst the
first of infantile maladies: it appears as if slumbering;
the eyelids are not perfectly closed,
and the white bulb of the eye is partly turned
upwards, and exposed to view; the eye-lashes
twinkle; there is a tremulous motion of the
muscles of the face and lips, sometimes resembling
a smile or laugh: as the disease increases,
the breath seems frequently to stop;
the tip of the nose is then contracted, with a
pale, sometimes ghastly and livid circle around
the eyes and mouth; it starts on any motion or
noise; sometimes it seems falling into convulsions,
but on discharging flatulent air upwards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">{386}</a></span>
and downwards, it recovers, and relapses again
into a lethargic state. By continuance, these
spasms often terminate in some of the following
diseases; hectic fever, thrush, vomiting,
diarrhœa and green feces, watery gripes,
convulsions. Infants also are sometimes subject
to a locked jaw; which we have already
noticed under Tetanus.</p>

<p>The predisposing and occasional <i>causes</i> of
convulsions and inward spasms are, acrid
stimulus of food, acidity, or bile, or inflammation
in its stomach or intestines; general
debility; the brain compressed during parturition,
hence mould shot, horseshoe head; water
in the brain; teeth cutting the gums;
passions and frights of the nurse affecting her
milk, or drinking raw spirituous liquors; improper
food of the nurse or infant; scald
head, excretion behind its ears, and cutaneous
rash repelled; they are usually imputed to
fulness and foulness of the stomach and intestines.
Lastly, Derangements in its yet crude
machinery.</p>

<p>Some adult mortality, but in all probability
a very inconsiderable portion, is included
in convulsions: infants are the principal victims.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">{387}</a></span>
The convulsive list diminishes during
the latter half of the present century: but
to unravel the problem respecting convulsive
increase or decrease, requires more elaborate
investigation than preceding calculators
and criticks seem to have suspected. It
is necessary to contrast the deaths by convulsions
and teething with the christenings;
for if more are born, more should be expected
to die in infancy. We must also take cognizance
of some other titles of London diseases,
particularly stoppage of the stomach,
colick and gripes of the guts; both which
have already been under review. Besides,
chrysoms and infants, an obsolete term, denoting
the deaths in the first month after
birth, is long exploded from the bills, and
probably ingulfed in convulsions.</p></div>

<h3 class="header"><i>Dentition.</i></h3> <p class="header">It is probable that the mortality
under this head is exaggerated enormously
in the London registers, amounting to one
fifteenth part of the annual burials. Dentition
usually commences about six or seven
months after birth; sometimes not before
ten, twelve, or eighteen months, and, in
some extraordinary instances, not before two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">{388}</a></span>
years of age. These sharp bones, in piercing
the tender gums, often excite exquisite pain,
restlessness, fever, flow of saliva; the infant’s
hand is frequently thrust into its mouth; it
bites the nipple; sometimes the gum is swelled
at the jutting of the tooth, and a pale spot
appears at the part where it endeavours to
protrude. When dentition is out of the natural
order, it is generally painful: in the natural
progress, the two foreteeth of the lower,
then those of the upper jaw; next, the two
adjacent of the upper, and afterwards of the
lower jaw, cut their way. After the eye-teeth,
or canine, in the upper, and those two
opposite to them in the lower jaw are protruded,
the danger of teething is generally
escaped. It is only in the first dentition, that
is, under two years of age, that mortality ensues
from this source: the fatal and most frequent
transition is into convulsions. About
two years of age, infants are generally provided
with twenty teeth for the purposes of
mastication: and this number remains stationary
until after seven years from birth, when
all the first set are gradually and successively
thrust out by others deeper seated in the jaw
bones; about the age of fourteen all are excluded;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">{389}</a></span>
and in adults the number is increased
to thirty-two.</p>

<div class="force_p"><h3 class="header"><i>Rickets.</i></h3> <p class="header">Notwithstanding the omission of
ancient authors to discriminate this disease,
we cannot believe but that, in this instance,
the same causes would in all ages have produced
the same effects. Rickets would seem
by the London registers to decrease; for in our
last group of fifteen years they shrink to 104;
whereas in the thirty last years of the preceding
century, ricketty deaths are numbered
at 11,415. To what cause is this decrease to
be ascribed? Does it indicate more maternal
attention, and also more propriety in suckling
and rearing of infants? Is implicit faith
to be placed in the London registers, and crimination
of diseases?</p>

<p>Rickets, one of the chronic diseases, seldom
commence before three, six, or nine
months after birth, generally between nine
months and two or three years of age, and
seldom or ever after five. The progressive
symptoms are aversion to motion, and to put
the feet to the ground, decrease of strength,
paleness and flaccidity of the muscles, wasting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">{390}</a></span>
of flesh, although in many the appetite
is voracious; enlarged belly, liver, spleen,
head, and joints; tumid and tympanitick abdomen;
laborious respiration; dentition later or
slower than usual; carious teeth; fetid breath;
premature acuteness of genius and reason than
is natural to the years; the countenance serious
and ancient; the infant waddles in its gait,
the spine and bones of the lower extremities
become crooked and deformed, the breast prominent.
The earlier rickets commence, they
are more contumacious; and when chronic
or fatal, are frequently accompanied with hectic
fever: they may continue several years,
and at length terminate in general bad health,
atrophy, dropsy. Should they not be checked
before the fifth, or at the utmost, the eighth
year, irremediable deformity must ensue,
which in females is often the cause of distorted
pelvis, and difficult labours. The predisponent
and occasional <i>causes</i> are hereditary;
weak diseased parents or nurses; negligent
nursing; not sufficient exercise nor cleanliness;
improper diet and gross food; worms;
foul stomach and intestines; scrophulous obstructed
mesenteric and lymphatic glands;
diseased liver; general bad health, with hectic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">{391}</a></span>
fever; various causes of atrophy; difficult
dentition; faulty state of ossification; deficiency
in the ossious rudiments; faults in the
organs of nutrition.</p></div>

<h3 class="header"><i>Thrush.</i></h3> <p class="header">In the preceding century, <i>Canker</i>
was often joined together in the London registers
with Thrush; but whether it should
be coupled with this or with gangrene, or
with both, I cannot determine. Thrush is
principally a disease of early infancy: it is likewise
often a concomitant symptom of some
febrile and acute diseases of adults. It infests
not the young alone, but also aged persons,
especially in cold northern and moist climates,
in damp situations, and in warm rainy seasons.
As an idiopathic disease of adults, it is rare
in this island. The disease generally appears
first on the tongue and roof of the mouth, in
small superficial red specks, and ash-coloured
ulcers, spreading gradually over the palate, fauces,
cheeks and lips; with anxiety, restlessness,
pain, difficulty of suction and deglutition, fever,
nausea, vomiting. After some time, the
ulcers form thick, tenacious incrustations,
shining like lard, ash-coloured, brown, rarely
black: these crustaceous layers scale off, but,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">{392}</a></span>
not unfrequently, after the interval of a few
days, are again renewed: the oftener the
worse: and in such cases they may be protracted
weeks. When the raw skin appears dry under
the crusts after desquamation, they are reproduced;
moisture there indicates a speedy and
favourable termination: diarrhœa frequently
supervenes.</p>

<h3 class="faux" title="N. B. Their other diseases are before described"></h3>

<p>In order to prevent the superfluous multiplication
of symptoms and diseases, and which
are common to all ages, I have, under the respective
titles of <i>Vomiting</i> and <i>Acidity</i>, <i>Colick</i>,
<i>Diarrhœa</i> and <i>Watery Gripes</i>, diseases so frequent
and harassing in infancy, added the discriminating
marks and peculiarities in those
early years. Small pox, measles, hooping
cough, croup, dropsy of the head and spine,
phthisis, hectic and atrophy, scald head, rash,
worms, have each been the subjects of preceding
investigation: ruptures make a part
of our subsequent inquiry.</p>

<h2 class="header"><a name="A_Miscellaneous_group_of_diseases" id="A_Miscellaneous_group_of_diseases"></a><span class="first-word">A</span> Miscellaneous group of diseases</h2> <p class="header">are here
associated: several of them unconnected
in symptom, cause, or cure: others are of
exotic origin, and transplanted amongst us.
Mankind left exposed, without defence or remedy,
against even this small morbid host,
would soon be sensible of the calamities and
scourge of medicinal ignorance: and they
would be less surprised at the incorporation
of medicine with divine worship in ancient
times.</p>

<div class="force_p"><h3 class="header"><i>Venereal Disease.</i></h3> <p class="header">Three hundred years have
not altogether elapsed since the discovery of
America, and the importation of the venereal
disease into the old world. Before the discovery
of its antidote, mercury, and in some inferior
degree of the native Indian remedy, the
decoction of guiacum, Europe was alarmed
with universal confirmation at the rapid
inroads of this disease: multitudes, of all
ranks, perished in lingering torture, under its
corroding ulcers, presenting before death hideous
spectacles of cadaverous corruption and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">{394}</a></span>
deformity. In the last thirty years of the
preceding century, 2360 deaths are recorded
under French pox, in the London bills; and
even at this day, the chart of diseases demonstrates
its fatality to be infinitely greater
than medical men could suspect.</p>

<p>It would, in this disease, be ridiculous to
inspect hospital registers, for the purpose of
either ascertaining the ages wherein venereal
ravages prevail, or the proportion of cured
and incurable. Its ravages cannot be in infancy,
nor in adolescence, nor in the decline
of life. The merest smatterer in medicine
knows the infallible remedy and cure I except
that in the application to particular cases,
some more judgment and dexterity is necessary.
The multitudes who now perish in
these battles of Venus, are so many sacrifices
either to negligence or to indigence; or
to the grossest ignorance and empiricism of
licenced murderers. There is no other disease
wherein professed quackery is so generally resorted
to, or wherein its decoys are so pernicious
to the community. The great majority
of these victims to seduction, pleasure,
and necessity, are in all probability amongst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">{395}</a></span>
the swarm of wretched and unfortunate female
prostitutes; and in the male sex amongst
the lower orders: for in those of less straitened
circumstances, a small bribe to the
searchers would conjure venereal mortality
into sores or ulcers, or into consumptions. Besides,
were we to add to venereal carnage the
shattered constitutions, in consequence of
these wounds and scars, it would appear an
object of sufficient magnitude to attract the
attention, interposition, and regulation of the
legislature. In every metropolis, especially
amongst the unmarried, and in armies and
navies, it is without doubt, much more fatal
to the community. Indeed, in cities, few of
the male sex, arrived at adult years, can boast
of not having been, in some giddy moment,
fascinated into impure embraces.</p>

<p>There are two distinct genera, or species, of
the venereal disease; the Local Gonorrhœa,
and what is called Confirmed Pox. The gonorrhœa
generally begins from two to six
days after the infection, with titillation of the
glans, redness of the orifice of the urethra, and
oozing of mucus; which tinges the linen in
spots and hardness. These symptoms are daily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">{396}</a></span>
aggravated with strangury, dysury, involuntary
painful priapism, and nocturnal pollution.
Sometimes, though rarely, gonorrhœa
is confined to the external mucous
glands about the neck or ring of the glans.
In females, the gonorrhœa affects principally
the vagina, with pain, heat, and mucous discharge;
but no considerable dysury. The
lues venerea confirmata, or syphilis, commonly
begins with either one or more ulcerations
of the penis, or vagina; or with inflammation
in the glands of the groin. The
ulcer or chancre appears as a red spot on the
glans, or prepuce, is hot, prurient; in a few
days the top changes into a white speck, ulcerates,
and, if not prevented, gradually
spreads and corrodes all around. Inflammation,
or bubo in the lymphatic glands of the
groin, may either originate from previous
chancre, or without it. In this a tumour and
pain is felt in the groin, with enlargement
of the glands; this tumour and inflammation,
if not checked, increases to a boil, and
suppuration; but often with tedious subsequent
ulcerations, fistulas, and sanious discharge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">{397}</a></span></p>

<p>These are the two usual and slight appearances
of gonorrhœa, and of confirmed pox,
when the infection is first applied to the genitals;
and frequently these two genera are
complicated. But in both genera, from various
causes, originating from the virulence
of the disease, the intemperance of the patient,
or mismanagement of his medical pilot,
many adventitious and aggravated symptoms
are superadded; in number and severity varying
in different persons; several of them,
when violent and precipitate, requiring speedy
alleviation; and often to be treated as separate
diseases. In the malign train of gonorrhœa
are violent inflammation and constriction
of the prepuce, before or behind the
glans, or phymosis, and paraphymosis; dysury,
strangury, priapism; painful and inflamed
testicles; scirrhous and indurated testicles;
chronic gleet; stricture, caruncles,
and obstructions in the urethra. Confirmed
pox, in its inveterate and chronic stages, contaminates
the whole constitution; erodes the
genitals, or anus; ascends to the throat, and
excites callous ulceration and dilapidation in
the uvula, tonsils, fauces, palate, nose; hence
hoarse, guttural voice, fetid breath: the patient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">{398}</a></span>
is variously tormented with gnawing
pains in the legs, shoulders, and hand bones,
which are exasperated in bed; with chronic
headach; with cutaneous eruptions on different
parts of the face, trunk, or extremities, and
dry, scaly, humid, ulcerated, red, yellow, or
purple; with ophthalmy; with nodes and tumour
of the forehead, exostoses and caries of
the bones; atrophy. Chronic warts about the
genitals and anus, and called by different
names, porri, crystæ, condylomata, rhagades,
thymi, moræ; are generally innocuous.</p>

<p>The <i>Causes</i>. Infection by contact with the
genitals: or the pox, when inveterate, may be
communicated by the mouth and nipples; by
drinking out of the same vessels, by touching
any diseased or ulcerated part. When inoculated
by suction, it begins first in the
mouth or nipples.</p></div>

<h3 class="header"><i>Scurvy.</i></h3> <p class="header">True scurvy is seldom or ever
mentioned by any writer, before the long
voyages, first began three centuries ago by
the moderns; that is, on the discovery of the
passage to Asia by the south cape of Africa;
and the discovery of America. Then, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">{399}</a></span>
consequence of living long on salted and gross
diet, and the want of fresh vegetables or
fruits, together with their ignorance of the
cause and cure, this disease made dreadful
havock amongst naval squadrons, and the
other busy hive employed in nautical commerce.
The ancient navigators, who seldom
ventured out of sight of land, or capes; and
who probably were not under the necessity of
subsisting long on salted food, do not appear
to have suffered by, nor even to have known,
the disease. Hippocrates is by some supposed
slightly to allude to scurvy, under the name
of large spleen; accompanied also with spungy
putrid gums, and offensive breath: it is also,
though indistinctly, noticed by Pliny, as affecting
a Roman army encamped on the banks
of the Rhine.</p>

<p>Through all the northern kingdoms of Europe,
particularly in the winter season, and
in Holland, amongst those who fed chiefly on
salted fish and gross diet; who drank bad waters,
and dwelt either in morasses, or near the
sea coasts, and were exposed to cold and
moisture, scurvy in the two last centuries
made cruel ravages. Several armies and besieged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">{400}</a></span>
garrisons in Germany, intercluded from
fresh vegetables; and numbers of the new
settlers in the northern colonies of America,
and who were in nearly the same predicament,
were cut off by the scurvy. The
North Americans were at last taught by the
Baltickers and Swedes the sovereign benefit
of substituting spruce beer, when fresh vegetables
cannot be found. The industrious
Dutch made drains and canals to carry off
water, and trusted the rest of the cure or
prevention to pickled cabbages or sour crout.
In the northern parts of Russia, where scurvy
is very universal, they found a particular acidulated
bread and sour drink, powerfully to
resist this disease.</p>

<p>By these and other precautions, the scurvy
is now much less formidable on land; but at
sea no other, the nervous and putrid fever
not excepted, is so inimical to navigators.
On that element it is yet the devouring monster
and tyrant. In the first voyages of our
East India Company’s ships, nearly one fourth
of the crews died at sea. Nautical records
teem with tragical narratives of scorbutic ravages.
But at present, the causes and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">{401}</a></span>
effectual antidotes, and the cure, are so well
known, that the greatest part of the lives
now lost by scurvy at sea, are either sacrificed
to gross negligence, or to impolitic and inhuman
economy. The temperature of sea
air is more equal than that on land: and
that it is not pernicious, we have an undoubted
proof in one of the late Captain
Cooke’s voyages; wherein, with a company
of 118 men, during a voyage of three years,
and through all climates, from 52 degrees
north to 71 south, he lost only one man by
sickness.</p>

<p>From 1671 to 1686, the deaths by scurvy
are in the London bills 9,451; but in the succeeding
fifteen years, decrease to 569 only:
and throughout the present century, continue
progressively on the declension. Even of this
trifling number, what proportion was engendered
at sea, or whether they all died of genuine
scurvy, I cannot decide. The theory of
the last century imputed many diseases to this
specific cacoethes, as they called it; which
would have some influence on the searchers
reports. In London, the lodgings are now
warm and dry, and the people in general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">{402}</a></span>
tolerably well cloathed: animal meat is eat
fresh; vegetables, though perhaps not universally
consumed in sufficient quantity, are
certainly in much greater abundance than
formerly: beer, fermented liquors, and tea,
are drank by all ranks. All these, in conjunction
with exercise, powerfully resist the
tendency to scorbutic corruption.</p>

<p>The progressive gradations and virulence
of scurvy, are distinguished under the three
following stages: the countenance becomes
pale, sickly, and bloated, with lassitude and
aversion to motion, and debility, on any exercise.
But the cardinal symptom is red,
spungy, enlarged gums, from which, on being
rubbed, blood issues, and the teeth begin
to loosen and fall out; the breath and urine
are fetid; and, by degrees, bruises and black
spots are seen in various parts, especially the
legs. In the next more aggravated stage, the
tendons at the hams begin to contract and
swell; there are pains in different parts; disposition
to salivation and hemorrhages from
the gums and nose, with increased debility
and proneness to syncope.  In the last and
most inveterate stages, putrid ulcers are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">{403}</a></span>
formed, particularly in the legs, which are
swelled and enlarged; or old cicatrices of former
ulcers are dissolved, and again break out,
from which issue a sanious and fetid discharge;
and within them is generated fungous
flesh, in confidence resembling a bullock’s
liver. Throughout there is no fever;
nor is the disease contagious; neither are the
appetite and senses impaired, except that
there is great despondency and melancholy.
The predisposing and occasional <i>causes</i> are cold
and moisture, and subsisting long on dried,
smoked, salted flesh meat or fish, without
vegetables, or these in small quantity; putrid,
and also gross diet difficultly digested,
not perspirable; corrupted stagnant water;
low marshy damp situations; cold situations;
the winter season of northern climates: wet
cold cloaths, beds, houses; insufficient or
suppressed perspiration, hence the corrupted
animal juices are not carried off; indolence,
sedentary life, confinement, dejection of mind,
melancholy; bad health; impurities of the
blood; diseases of the spleen.</p>

<h3 class="header"><i>Scrofula</i>,</h3> <p class="header">Struma, King’s Evil. In the last
thirty years of the preceding century, the mortality<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">{404}</a></span>
by evil is only 2,126, in the London bills;
and throughout the present century continues
decreasing. This, however, is a very partial
representation of its fatality, which in its consequence
is far more destructive. The disease
seldom appears under two years of age; commonly
between three and seven, and sometimes
not until near puberty; after which
its evolution and first appearance is very rare.
The children of fair hair, rosy cheeks, smooth
skin, soft delicate complexion and temperament,
are more obnoxious to scrofula than
those of an opposite temperament. It is sometimes
introduced by a tumid upper lip, and
chop in the middle of it; at other times the
first appearance is oval moveable tumours in
the lymphatic glands of the neck, under the
chin, or below the ears. These tumours often
continue inert one, two, or more years, and
without pain, until they tend towards suppuration;
and are various in size, from a walnut
to an egg, or larger.  At length there
is some fluctuation, ulceration, and exudation
of viscid serum, but no concocted pus;
the ulcers spread unequally; their edges are
not callous; yet they are very tardy in cicatrizing.
In this way there is a succession of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">{405}</a></span>
tumours and ulcers during several years; the
former alternately subsiding whilst the ulcers
are open; some cicatrizing, and others breaking
out; and most so in the spring season.</p>

<p>Commonly after four or five years, or towards
puberty, the cervical ulcers finally
close, leaving behind indelible scars. This
entailed alloy is often the source of bad
health. Sometimes the eyes or eyelids are
particularly afflicted with scrofulous ophthalmy.
In other cases it excites tumours,
deep seated abscess, anchylosis, and caries in
various joints of the elbow, fingers, knees,
feet; or stubborn ulcers in different parts:
and still more deleterious consequences ensue
from scrofulous glands of the lungs or mesentery
terminating in phthisis, or hectick.
Some nations more than others, are afflicted
with scrofula. I have read that it is not
frequent in tropical climates; and it is not
contagious. The predisposing and occasional
<i>causes</i> are hereditary: diseases of the lymphatic
glands; consequence of small pox:
whether it is more prevalent in some countries
than others from the air, water, diet, or
other causes, is not yet ascertained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">{406}</a></span></p>

<h3 class="header"><i>Leprosy.</i></h3> <p class="header">A considerable part of the Mosaical
code, politically and medicinally, is
pointed against this disease. It is now, in a
great degree, eradicated and worn out of Europe.
After the Crusades, in the twelfth century,
Europe was overspread with this hideous
judaical scurf, imported from Palestine. Lazarettoes
for the confinement of the unclean,
were then numerous in many kingdoms: in
France alone there were two thousand. At
present, in the cold northern island, Iceland,
a sort of leprosy is congenial to the natives,
from their diet, climate, and mode of life.
And in the history of the late discoveries in
the Pacific Ocean, we read of a leprous scurf
infesting the natives, from their excessive indulgence
in a hot spice amongst their food. In
our island, at this day, a considerable number
are afflicted with a disgusting cutaneous
scurf; but greatly inferior in virulence to the
Asiatic leprosy. The absolute mortality in
the London bills by this disease, is almost
undeserving of notice.</p>

<h2><a name="TO_THE_READER" id="TO_THE_READER">TO THE READER.</a></h2>


<p>We must here abruptly, and with regret, but for
obvious reasons, the size to which this Publication is
already swelled, cut off the remainder of our comments,
amounting to nearly one hundred pages more.
Those left behind unnoticed of the last group, comprehend
most of the chronic cutaneous diseases, the subjects,
peculiarly, of the Cosmetic Art. Through the
last group of external accidents and diseases, I meant
to have persevered in my general plan. For instance,
under Gangrene, I should have discriminated the ages,
mortality, cures; and at the same time, that originating
from external injuries, or surgical operations, and
that from spontaneous corruption. Under Fractures,
I should have gauged the success and miscarriage of amputation,
both after sudden accidents, and in consequence
of chronic diseases. This is a most important
part of military surgery, and I believe, in a great measure,
unexplored. From the trepan and lithotomy, I
should also have stated the blanks and prizes. With
the surgical group I am obliged to omit the casualties
of London: one alone of which I could not entirely
postpone, without introducing a few observations in
this place, that is the Executed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">{408}</a></span></p>

<h3 class="header"><i>Executed.</i></h3> <p class="header">Murder, robbery, sedition, and
war, are amongst the principal political casualties,
chronic distempers, fevers, and frenzies
of every nation. In ascertaining the
numbers executed, particularly, the London
bills of mortality are shamefully erroneous
and defective. As I thought it a casualty of
infinite importance to be exactly stated and
recorded, I made numerous efforts to procure
authentic information, by successively and
repeatedly waiting upon the Keeper of Newgate,
the Clerk of the Arraigns, the Clerk
of the Peace for the County, the Town-Clerk
of London, the Sheriff’s office of
London, and the Secretary of State’s.
Throughout this inquiry I was every where
treated with liberality and urbanity; and
where there was any prospect of information,
was permitted access to the records. But, to
my astonishment and mortification, I could
not find any vestige of records of executions
in London before 1754. These were
in the Clerk of Arraigns’ office, but were
buried in a heap of extraneous law rubbish;
and to extract which, the Clerk of the Arraigns
told me, it would require three entire
days for myself and one of his clerks. I called
twice at the Old Bailey, anxious to undertake<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">{409}</a></span>
this task, however laborious; but it so happened,
that at both times they were full of
business in the office, and could not spare
time, nor even room, for my inquiry. By
other means, I have come near part of the
truth. (<i>Vid.</i> <span class="smcap"><a href="#A_CHART_of_all_the_Fatal_Diseases_and_Casualties_in_London_during_75_Years">Chart</a></span>.)</p>

<p>The two first columns, from 1732 to 1762,
are formed from an average of executions,
during twenty-two years of that interval, by
Sir Theodore Jansen, Chamberlain of London.
The last column, of fifteen years, is
formed from an average of the last seven
years, with which Mr. Akerman politely
furnished me, from his books. In consequence
of the riots and conflagration in 1780, his records
were all consumed, and do not include
that year, wherein there was a notorious
glut of executions. During the seven years,
beginning with 1781, the executed in Mr.
Akerman’s books were 439. But every one
knows that there are two theatres, a great
and a small one, appropriated for human
slaughter in this metropolis; these are Tyburn,
now removed to Newgate; and for the
large Borough of Southwark, Kennington
Common. I took a low average of the executions
in the latter, allotting three annually,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">{410}</a></span>
to the two first columns, and six to the last
column, and added the whole together.
Amongst the London malefactors there are a
few pirates, whose crimes are cognizable in
the Admiralty Court.</p>

<p>Two thirds, probably, of all those capitally
condemned, are afterwards pardoned. Few,
comparatively, of the executed have committed
murder, not one in twenty; most of the rest
are for robberies of various kinds. Many more
are reported as murdered in the bills of mortality:
but these are not cases of premeditated
and malicious homicide, and are softened into
manslaughter on trial. Nineteen out of
twenty of the executed are males; and by far
the greatest proportion between eighteen and
forty years of age. What is the proportion
of London executions to the whole nation, is
a problem which perhaps our judges cannot
unravel. They possibly, like the generality
of physicians, drive and strut away, “secundum
artem,” in the beaten rotine of their
profession, without ever attending to a plain
political and mercantile axiom, to state their
transactions and accounts in numbers and figures.
Vice and executions are universally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">{411}</a></span>
more prevalent in every metropolis: but there
is reason to believe, that at present the executions
throughout Britain and Ireland, are
double or treble to those of London. The
comparative population is as nine million to
six hundred and fifty thousand. If they are
treble, then 4000 are executed every fifteen
years in the two islands; and 26,000 in a
century: and both the disease and panacea
are rapidly increasing. Five or six times
this number are, in the same period, transported
to distant regions, and partly also lost
to the community, together with their
blighted procreation.</p>

<p>We are struck with horror even on reading
the history of savage jurisprudence, customs,
and butchery of mankind in ancient times;
such as the sanguinary codes of Draco and
other regal monsters; the sacrifices to idols;
the martyrs to gloomy fanaticism; the brutal
spectacles of the Romans, wherein gladiators,
lions and tygers, were exposed to tear each
other to pieces. But I doubt whether, in the most
flagitious and facinorous ages of Rome, the
Tarpeian rock was besmeared with the blood
of such a multitude of human victims; or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">{412}</a></span>
that in any part of the globe, from London
to the Antipodes, out of an equal proportion
of mankind, there are so many sacrifices annually
made to violated jurisprudence; and
to the modern idol, property and money! I
meant to have contrasted the executed with
those destroyed in wars, by the sword of the
enemy (exclusive of diseases) during the present
century; but the introduction would be
here premature; nor could I launch out in
sufficient illustration.</p>

<p>Besides the political patients doomed to the
radical cure, or extermination, by the executioner,
if we may credit one of our best writers,
they are a mere handful compared to
those who are consigned to a slow and lingering
death. Dr. Johnson, in one of his excellent
essays in the Rambler, against perpetual
imprisonment for debt, calculates, that
half a million of mankind are destroyed in a
century in the prisons of Great Britain, by
the complicated horror of confinement, sorrow,
famine, filth, and disease; and to these
I would add suicide. I am inclined, however,
to believe, that Dr. Johnson’s computation
is exaggerated, by at least four hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">{413}</a></span>
thousand. By far the largest proportion of
these are unfortunate sacrifices to poverty and
misfortunes, and to the callous vindictiveness
of avarice. In the juridical pharmacopœia,
this may be compared to the hot iron and
cautery of the coarse empiricks of antiquity;
with which they outrageously and indiscriminately
tortured their patients. It would
not disgrace the christianity or humanity of
our legislature and lawyers, were they to
revise their catechism and breviary of jurisprudence,
both as affecting life and liberty: or,
throwing religion and humanity to one side,
let the question be tried by commercial scales;
and, like the Venetian Jew, human flesh estimated
in ounces and pounds with brutes,
metals, and chattels!</p>

Births, Mortality, and Diseases; their
Defects, besides those already pointed out; important
and easy Improvements recommended.</i></a></h2>


<p>We shall now, with all possible brevity,
enquire into the degrees of credibility and stability
of the mathematical and medical data,
furnished from the bills of mortality. The
births, genealogies, procreation, multiplication,
and deaths, of those few miracles of longevity,
from Adam to Noah; from Noah’s
descendants down to Abraham, Moses, and
Christ, are recorded in scripture: some chapters
of Genesis are plain registers of births and
mortality. The male Israelites, above twenty
years of age, were, at distant intervals, mustered
and numbered by Moses and his successors;
and in a few uncommon pestilences,
the devastation is ascertained in the Jewish
history. The descent and pedigree of kings,
and other great men, have also been kept in
most nations, who had made any progress
in civilization: but general annual registers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">{415}</a></span>
of births, diseases, and deaths, are modern
establishments, and were unknown to the
ancients.</p>

<p>On the continent of Europe, registers were
instituted fifty or a hundred years before their
introduction into England. In 1538, exact
records of weddings, christenings, and burials,
were first ordered by the King and council, to
be kept in every parish church of England,
by either the vicar or curate. But this order
was very negligently obeyed in many parishes,
until 1559, when, to prevent registers
from rotting in damp churches, they were
directed to be written on parchment. At first,
they seem, both in Germany and England, to
have been designed to prove the birth, death,
and descent of individuals, and the right of
inheritance in property or lands. In 1592, a
year of pestilence, bills of mortality for London
were instituted; but were discontinued
until 1603, another year of pestilential desolation;
which was the only distemper then
taken notice of in the printed reports.  In
1626, the different diseases and casualties
of those who died in London, together with
the distinction of the sexes, were added and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">{416}</a></span>
published; and in 1728, the different ages of
the dead were ordered to be specified in the
London bills. Upon first establishing the distinction
of diseases and casualties in the bills
of the British metropolis, the primary intention
seems to have been, to distinguish the
numbers destroyed by the plague, and to detect
concealed murders.</p>

<p>Public records of births and mortality are
now partly become the rules of political arithmetic:
but unfortunately for politicians, calculators
of annuities, and medical men, they
are yet every where far too incorrect and incomplete.
Registers of diseases and deaths in
London are entrusted to old women, two of
whom are nominated in each parish, and
called Parish Searchers, and who consider, the
ultimatum of their commission is merely to
prevent private funerals and concealed murder.
The whole business in London is conducted
in the following manner: Upon either
being sent for to inspect a corpse, or on hearing
the bell toll, and inspecting the books
kept in the different churches, the searchers
are apprised from whence notice has been
sent of a death, in order that a grave may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">{417}</a></span>
opened. The two parochial matrons then,
whose industry is stimulated by a small fee
on each corpse, and whose report is necessary
previous to interment, set out to examine that
no violence is committed upon the dead, of
which they have taken an official oath to
make true declaration, and afterwards negligently
enquire from the relations the name of
the disease, adding the age and sex: or sometimes
they are stopped in the hall, and dismissed
without any scrutiny. These records,
together with the christenings, in the latter
of which the searchers have no concern, are
deposited with the respective clerks of each
parish church, and by the clerks the christenings
of the established church, and the burials
in their respective parochial church-yards
alone, are carried once every week to a general
hall in the city: on the following day the
weekly bill, comprehending these partial returns,
is printed and published; and at the
end of the year a general bill, in which all
the weekly returns are consolidated.</p>

<p>The law ordains, that every person who dies
in the registered parishes of London, Westminster,
and Southwark, is to be inspected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">{418}</a></span>
by two parish searchers, and reported to the
parish clerk, who then grants his certificate
for the interment: or, if the corpse is carried
away to a different parish of the metropolis
for interment, the searchers report, and the
clerk’s certificate, are equally necessary;
otherwise that parish where the corpse is buried
is liable to a fine. This process was originally
intended to detect the plague, and
concealed murders; in both which respects,
during the present century, the parish clerks
and the searchers have been almost useless.
There is now no plague to detect; there are
very few murders, and they are always proclaimed
by some other means. Even in the
preceding century, when the plague raged in
London, the searchers report was rarely
trusted without a physician or surgeon attending,
to prevent mistakes.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this ceremony of inspection
by the searchers, and of making their reports
to the parish clerk, it does not hence
follow, that the clerk makes the return of
the death to the general hall, <i>unless the corpse
is buried in his own ground, or parochial church-yard</i>.
If the corpse is carried to any dissenting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">{419}</a></span>
ground, and to various other places of sepulture
not within the bills, the death and
disease is so much waste paper, and is never
heard of amongst the burials. But if the
corpse is carried to a different parish, together
with a certificate, and such burying ground
is registered within the bills, then the death
and disease is returned to the hall by the clerk
of that parish where the corpse is interred.</p>

<p>I made it my business to visit, and to converse
with a variety of parish clerks in this
metropolis, most of whom agreed with me,
that, besides radical defects in the christenings
and burials, there were many other gross
omissions. One instance I shall mention, and
many more might be collected. The parish
clerk of Bethnal-green, in which are also
three private madhouses, made no return to
the general hall, during the year 1780, of
either births or burials, and in the preceding
year he returned only four burials: whereas
in former years, this parish alone annually
returned from three to five hundred burials.
I was assured, that the company of parish
clerks in their corporate capacity, even if willing,
have no power of compulsion over any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">{420}</a></span>
of their refractory and negligent members, to
make regular and correct returns: it seems
almost optional. It is obvious what flagrant
discordance and error this must occasion in
various calculations.</p>

<p>Exclusive of gross mismanagement and error
from searchers and parish clerks, there
are other inherent defects in the London registers,
both of burials and births. They
comprehend the births alone of those belonging
to the established church, and the burials
of such only who are interred in the registered
parochial church-yards. Jews, Quakers,
Papists, Protestant Dissenters of various sects,
are not included in the annual christenings;
and great numbers of their burials, and of the
burying-places not only of the dissenting, but
likewise of the established church, are omitted:
of the former 32, and of the latter 35,
according to Short’s list. Maitland, 1729,
(see his History of London) discovered 181
religious congregations, whose christenings
were not published, and 63 burying-places
in and contiguous to the metropolis, wherein
3038 were annually buried, but excluded
from the registers. The large modern and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">{421}</a></span>
populous parishes of Pancras and Mary-le-bone,
in one of which also stands the Foundling
Hospital, are omitted in the annual bills.
Six hundred abortive and stillborn, who have
arrived at an age thought deserving of funeral,
are added to the annual deaths, but
omitted in the list of births; as are also many
young infants who die before baptism.</p>

<p>I said, very few of the christenings of the
dissenting sects in London were included in
the public registers; but several of them are
buried according to the formalities, or at
least in the cemeteries of the established
church; which must unnaturally magnify
the comparative list of deaths. Another defect
in the burials is, that numbers are carried
into the country who are not accounted
for: it is agreed, that several hundreds more
are annually carried out of than are brought
into London for interment. Most of the nobility
and gentry are removed from London,
after death, to their family seats. Dr. Price
calculates the present annual deficiency in the
London burials at 6000; and of the births
somewhat greater; neither of which are
brought to account in the registers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">{422}</a></span></p>

<p>The following is an average, which I have
formed from the London bills of christenings
and burials:</p>

<p>The parishes, but not all the burial grounds
in these parishes, now included within the
London bills of mortality, amount to 147:
of which there are 97 within the old city
walls; 17 without the walls, but within the
city liberties; 23 out parishes in Middlesex
and Surry; and 10 out parishes in the city
and liberties of Westminster. All the 97
parishes within the walls have not, for many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">{423}</a></span>
years past, at a medium, buried 2000 annually:
some of them do not make a return
of a single burial in several years. We may
name several parishes without the walls, any
two of which united, return a number of
annual deaths equal to the 97 parishes within
the walls. In collecting and conducting the
bills of these parishes, there is a rabble of
294 female searchers, and 147 parish clerks.</p>

<p>To render the returns of births, christenings,
weddings, and burials in London complete,
the clergyman of every religious sect
should be compelled by law to make, every
three months, a return of their christenings
and weddings to the nearest parochial church.
All the church-yards and burying grounds
hitherto excluded from the bills, together
with the parishes of Pancras, Mary-le-bone,
and all the other modern additions and population
to London, should likewise be comprehended
in the registers; together with the
numerous villages and excrescences of the
metropolis, within seven miles of its circumference.
The christenings should specify the
name, sex, twins or tergemini, illegitimate if
known, and the religious sect. The weddings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">{424}</a></span>
should discriminate the place of abode,
of the parties, the names and ages of each
pair; whether first, second, or third marriages,
and on which side; whether natives
or foreigners, and the religious sect.</p>

<p>There appears at present no necessity to
return weekly bills from the different parishes.
This was originally intended to warn
the London inhabitants of the numbers destroyed
by the plague, and the infected parishes.
Quarterly returns to the general hall would
be sufficient; and one general annual bill,
in which the quarterly mortality should be
distinguished; in order to point out the seasons
most noxious, and the reigning diseases;
or to mark the hurricanes and monsoons of
mortality. In infancy, and the early part
of life, when the tide of devastation is strong
and rapid, the mortality should be measured
in shorter intervals. The first year from
birth should be divided into interstices, from
birth to six months, when teething commences;
from six months to one year; from
one to two; two to three; three to four;
four to five; five to ten; ten to twenty; and so
on to one hundred and upwards. Exclusive of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">{425}</a></span>
abortions and stillborn, those who die in
the first month before baptism, and of course
cannot be included in the christenings, should
be distinguished, in order to determine more
accurately the amount of the births. Separate
columns should be assigned for the name
of the disease or casualty; for the cause, if
known; and the duration of the affliction.
Annexed to each disease should be the numbers
dying at different ages of that malady.
Males grown up to maturity who die, should
be distinguished either as married, widowers,
or bachelors; and females also of this description,
either as married, widows, or virgins.
Those carried out of London, or into
it, for interment; the parochial children who
die at nurse in the vicinity of the metropolis;
the rank, profession, or trade; whether native
or foreigner; should all appear in the general
annual report in separate columns. The annual
reports of all the hospitals, dispensaries,
and prisons, and of the executed, should also
be made to the hall, and included in the general
annual register.</p>

<p>There are often objections and scruples to
apply effectual remedies, or radical cures, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">{426}</a></span>
ancient institutions, however defective and
inadequate.  There certainly is no necessity
for such a cumbrous complex machinery, or
multitude of parish searchers and clerks, for
conducting the London bills. Indeed they
might probably be all dispensed with. The
reports of the relations of the deceased, or of
the parish officers, to the curate of the different
churches, would perhaps answer every
purpose; and the perquisites would be a considerable
addition to the clerical pittance. I
mean, however, only to offer a simple, easy,
and unexceptionable palliative; which is, to
appoint a physician to superintend the general
hall, and the reports of births, burials,
and diseases: and the whole to be subjected to
the inspection of a committee of the Medical
College, or of the Royal or Medical Societies.
This would give authenticity, credibility,
and respectability to the registers. From such a
rich mine, and an authentic magazine, the most
important and beneficial information would be
derived; the increase or decrease of deaths,
marriages, and births; the annual waste of the
metropolis; the health, mortality, the diseases
most fatal, their growth or declension; the
effects of diet, drink, and medical practice.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">{427}</a></span>
Calculators of annuities, reversions, survivorships,
and insurances, would then be supplied
with certain, instead of conjectural
data: at present this alone is a prodigious article
of traffick and commerce in this country:
much litigation and expence respecting
births and deaths, and the right to inheritance,
would also be prevented. In a word,
a vast variety of most interesting medical and
political propositions, which are entangled in
intricacy and obscurity, would, by this
means, be evolved, and indisputably demonstrated.</p>

<p>It is also most devoutly to be wished, for
the health, comfort, and decency of the metropolis,
that all, or at least the majority of
the burying grounds, were ordered to be
formed in some dry spots of ground at the
different extremities of the city; and that the
dead were more detached from the living.
No one whose curiosity for information has
led him to these melancholy wrecks of human
vanity, and to behold the yawning
mouths of sepulchres, can reflect without
pain and astonishment, on the manner in
which between twenty and thirty thousand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">{428}</a></span>
corpses are annually crammed into various
holes, corners, public thoroughfares, and
churches of this city: a feeling mind must
shudder at, and shrink from the description.
Nor can these cadaverous exhalations fail to
pollute the air, and to engender diseases. Let
the clerical revenue arising from graves be
transferred to the new cemeteries.</p>

<p>We shall conclude, by pointing out the
most celebrated treatises on human propagation,
existence, mortality, and morbid devastation,
by several philosophers. This is the
epoch of a new science in politicks, philosophy,
and medicine. Meritorious and successful
efforts have been made to calculate
the prospects of life and death, as the chances
on dice, or the blanks and prizes in a lottery
wheel. Graunt, somewhat later than the
middle of the last century, first wrote a treatise
on the London bills of births and mortality,
and was followed soon after by Petty,
King, and Davenant. The present century
has produced several treatises on this subject;
of which the most celebrated are Dr. Halley’s;
De Moivre’s Treatises on Annuities and
Chances; Susmilch’s Calculations; Simpson’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">{429}</a></span>
Select Exercises; some essays in the Philosophical
Transactions; Dr. Jurin on the
Small Pox <i>only</i>; Dr. Short’s Observations on
various Bills of Mortality; M. Messance; Dr.
Price’s Essays, the Archimedes in annuitant
and reversionary calculation; Birch’s Collection
of the London Bills of Mortality to 1759;
Dr. Percival’s Essays; Dr. Millar’s Calculations
respecting the Diseases of Great Britain,
and Military Diseases; and Dr. Robinson’s,
respecting Maritime Diseases.</p>

<p>Our curtain being now ready to fall, we
shall address a few words to the Reader.—The
present Publication had its origin in so
short a time from the following circumstance.
About six months ago, the President of the Medical
Society of London called upon the author,
at the desire of the Society, to request that he
would deliver the annual oration, which was
then fixed at four months distance only from
that period: to which, with some reluctance,
he consented. Indeed, he considered the solicitation
both as a compliment, and a literary
challenge: because, by the rules of the Society,
one year’s previous notice to the orator
had been the invariable practice. In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">{430}</a></span>
execution of this arduous and unprecedented
attempt, the author is not ashamed to boast of
industry and zeal. Were he to enumerate,
in narrative and detail, the difficulties and fatigue
which he had to encounter in collecting
merely the materials of new information, he
is persuaded that most gentlemen would have
considered that alone sufficient exercise for
their industry, patience, and perseverance
during many months. Had he chosen to
have followed the rhetorical path of the London
College, his talk would have been far
less onerous. But notwithstanding the eminent
talents scattered throughout that learned
body, from Linacre down to Hulse, Wintringham,
Baker, Warren, Turton, &amp;c. their
united catalogue of public declarations, however
classical, have not much contributed to
medical edification, or public utility.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
